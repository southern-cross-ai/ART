" And Greg Kerrin is my guest. Hello Greg.

 G'day Trevor how are you.

 Very well thank you how are you.

 Good I'm good thank you.

 You're looking very festive in a very uh well it's a Hawaiian shirt but it's red it's it's almost Christmassy isn't it.

 Red and white that's right it's  that time of the year isn't it.

 I like that yes . Yes now uh what sort of flower that's the hibiscus uh it would be have uh being a real Hawaiian shirt wouldn't it.

 Absolutely.

 Okay yes. Glad you can identify the flower that's on your shirt.

 I'm glad you can . Shows you're listening to the program .

  Not not not a great flower to try and grow in Tassie though.

 Uh there are a few of them growing around . In pockets in warm pockets yes absolutely. Um.

 What up in the north-east somewhere.

 No my word no no not uh in Hobart they're growing very well . They'll grow on the east coast but they'll grow in Hobart as well uh there are a few of them around Newtown  uh a few around Lenah Valley so you do  see them around.

 Okay  alright but the  but prefer but prefer a warmer climate.

 They would prefer a warm climate yes  but uh in a sun trap they're a great little plant to grow.

 Alright well thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is the number at this time of the year people taking breaks getting out and about and plenty of time to get out in the garden so I wouldn't be surprised if we have quite a few questions from our listeners this afternoon Graham from Hobart first cab off the rank how are you Graham.

 Fine thank you. Uh Greg do you know anything about truss tomatoes . The expensive ones  seven or eight dollars a kilo from the supermarket.

 Yes yes.

 Uh well I've got ten plants growing.

 Yeah.

 They're about ten centimetres high but the stems are very thin do I do anything with them or is that what they  they do they grow on a vine.

 They'll grow on a vine Graham  so look to promote the the the stem growth  and uh help them thicken up pinch the the side laterals outta them. Until they get to a reasonable height  and l then let them grow and expand uh and then they'll start fruiting.

 Oh very good. Uh another thing y'know the gentleman last week that couldn't get any apricots on his tree.

 Yeah yeah.

 Yes yes up at Swansea way wasn't he.

 No he was up in the north.

 I had uh I have got two tamarillo trees one  exactly the same size and planted the same day. One has massive fruit the other one didn't have any . So I fed it about four handfuls of um sulfate of potash  every week for about four or five weeks. The leaves started to turn brown on the edges so I stopped. All those leaves fell off and then the new leaves and fruit there's m masses on the tree.

 Good. Well that's good.

 So it's it's massive doses of the uh.

 Of the sulfate of potash.

 Potash.

 Yeah yeah  thanks Graham.

 No problem.

 Alright Graham thank you for your call Patricia from Montrose good afternoon Patricia.

 Uh good afternoon gentlemen um I have a passionfruit a Nelly Kelly a grafted one  that I've had for about six years. It's been struggling along. This year it's had about twenty flowers on it and all but one have dropped off. And that one has got a swelling in it that looks like a passionfruit. Y'know is is something I'm doing that I'm not getting passionfruit or what.

 I reckon Patricia that your passionfruit is a little bit hungry . Okay is it a little bit is it a little bit pale and yellowy in the leaves.

 I've cut the yucky leaves off  and I'm left with uh rather nice um um fresh green leaves.

 Fresh green leaves good okay  I reckon it's a little bit hungry. Now  um Nelly Kelly passionfruit are really heavy feeders and by that I mean you're going to need to feed them more than once a year you're gunna need to feed them at least two or three times a year and the best thing to use on them is either super phosphate right  or a complete fertiliser . Now if you give your Nelly Kelly passionfruit at least two or three good handfuls of that and water it in throughout the year you'll not only get lush growth and have very green leaves uh but you'll also tt get an abundance of fruit coming through.

 I see  so what you're saying is that the passionfruit has not been fed enough  enough to enable it to make fruit is that what you're saying.

 That's right because uh 'cos when you th you picture your passionfruit in your mind you've got these g really big  glossy green leaves with  lovely long leaders and tendrils. Now  it takes uh a lot of uh energy to maintain those big green leaves to begin with  and it also takes a lot of energy to grow with big green leaves . Okay  and that's why it needs a good feed  and regularly .

 Patricia have you got much fruit at all over the six years. Nothing at all really.

 None.

 Yeah.

 Okay it's just struggled all the way.

 My first fruit and I'm sitting down there guarding it .

 Bet you are day and night .

 Well then make sure you're the only one that enjoys  that fruit Patricia.

 I will don't worry about that .

 Good on you.

 Thank you.

 Okay.

  Thanks Patricia . Jeez talk about hard fruits for your labour. Uh thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is our number l lot of listeners phone in to say that they've got Nelly Kellys uh uh generally speaking Greg are they  more easy to grow in the passionfruit fam.

 Um it's not so much that they're easy to grow Trevor it's that they're such a great fruit . They're a lovely fruit to eat they're the definitely the pick of the passionfruits.

 They're one of the sweeter fruit are they.

 They're one of the sweeter ones but they've also one of these plants or fruiting plants has been around since the year dot. They're like a moor puhp morg puh puh muh  puh like a Moor Park apricot  or uh a Meyer lemon. They're they're proven winners they're reliable uh and people just keep coming back to them . And every so often you get a new variety that comes in and and a few people test them and they come back and they say nah it's not as good as the Nelly Kelly . You can't beat it.

 Alright . Thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is our number and I should uh mention too that we're gunna offer up a copy of the the latest issue of the A B C Limelight magazine. So to our best caller this afternoon and Greg will be keeping a close ear on you uh we will offer a copy of uh the A B C's Limelight magazine some good reading over summer and indeed uh when we're looking for some decent entertainment on the radio and the box you'll find it there 'n' some good stories too. John from Newtown g'day John.

 Hello.

 Yes John hello.

 Oh sorry old mate I didn't realise you were so quick.

 Oh that's alright John.

 Um good afternoon to you both number one I've guh old lady across the road my dear old mate gave me some great big fat juicy bulbs the name of which I can only remember she called them naked ladies.

 Yeah yeah.

 She said that they wouldn't um flower the first year but I've  planted them out in sort of good compost and they burst out in loads and loads of green leaves but no flower  now this year will they flower.

 Yeah they will now uh a bulb like a naked lady likes being rather pot-bound or root-bound  and it's bound up so if you put it in the pot John  it'll probably flower next year  but if you put it in the ground it'll probably flower the year after.

 Gotcha  so do these ones I've I've got some in a pot which didn't flower last year  but they're I put a hell of a lot in so they must be getting pretty pushed together.

 Yih that's w that's what you want you want those roots to really mat down together and then it'll start to flower.

 So these ones should  come up with a bit of a flower this year.

 That's right and then around about say every ooh oh five or six years you can take to them with a spade  and and and thin them out a little bit  and then they'll start flowering again.

 May I ask you the proper name it always sounds a bit sort of rude to.

 Saying naked lady bulbs .

 There's nothing wrong with saying naked lady bulbs they've been aruh they're another one. They've been around for so long. People know them as naked ladies or nerines.

 Wuh my old prim and proper mate unfortunately of course she died lih last year  she was eighty-six and  she called her that I thought well if a lady like her can call a.

 .

 Naked ladies yeah. They're called nerines  John nerines.

 Good man thanks for your help.

 Okay.

 Thank you John . Uh thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred for Gardening Talkback on Nine-Three-Six A B C Hobart Iris from Sandy Bay hello Iris.

 Hello. Um I wonder if you could help me with my irises both  both Dutch and flag.

 Yes.

 They won't flower um. They have all the foliage  both um the flag ones in particular have um yep beautiful big wide tall  leaves but nothing happens. I expose the rhizomes to the sun. I fertilise them.

 What with Iris.

 Um the pellet stuff.

 Yep.

 Yun in  that outdoor  stuff and uh occasionally some seeh uh uh seaweed g uh liquid  Aquasol or something and um  uh I've got about thirty and I got about three . And I didn't  get any Dutch irises.

 H h how long have you had the flag irises in for.

 A long long time.

 Alright well I think you're being too kind to them.

 Ooh.

 Well I didn't think I mean they grow wild in in the country don't they.

 That's exactly why I think you're being too kind to them. You are feeding them too much and they're sitting back there and they're very complacent they're happy 'n' they're getting fat 'n' they don't have to they don't have to  flower for you  . So they're not going to.

 I wondered if I I should dig them up and put them in a new bed.

 Absolutely not no leave them where they are but don't fl uh feed them for at least another two or three years . Alright it sounds like you're over feeding them and they're they're just in a in a puchih position where they just they don't have to do anything.

 We are in clay.

 Doesn't matter.

 Oh well that's .

 Doesn't matter.

 In y'know as I said in the country you see them absolutely neglected 'n' they  flower beautifully.

 Exactly and that's exactly why we don't want you to feed them anymore.

 Right.

 And that kinda goes against the grain doesn't it because you listen to me all the time 'n' I'm saying feed it  feed it feed it but in this case don't.

 Starve it.

 Yes.

 Well it has this lush growth but nothing else.

 Yeah and that's why. You're feeding them too much . Okay now as far as your other irises go are you doing the same thing . Are you feeding them a lot.

 Uh wuh yes uh the whole garden geh  I d I duh don't put much sheep manure or stuff about I find that's  hard to get 'n'  uh it's easier to buy something .

 Okay well look for the next two years or so uh avoid feeding the iris beds  right completely and let them dry out a little bit as well.

 Yes well they are um and have been f kept fairly damp.

 Right yeah well you want them to dry out a little bit. You wanna stress them a bit because that's how you're gunna make them flower . They're one of these plants that really reacts well to stress . So the more stress you f you give them by not feeding them very often and not watering them too much the better the flowers and the prolonged flowering season.

 Oh I'll  just ignore them then.

 Yes .

 Mm and Iris don't you get too stressed going hard on your irises okay.

  Thank you very much .

 Thanks Iris bye-bye.

 Have a nice Christmas . Seventeen minutes to three.



 Trevor Jackson and Greg Kerrin this afternoon for Gardening Talkback sixteen minutes to three good afternoon Peter how are you.

 Good afternoon Trevor.

 What can we do for you Pete.

 Uh Greg regarding my walnut tree that I spoke to you about eighteen months ago I mentioned to your brother when he was last in I think it was week before last  I dunno when he passed on the message or not that uh you told me to take to it with a broom handle . Which I did . 'N' last year it grew about a metre  . Sixteen seventeen years old by the way  and it grew about a metre still no fruit. This year has grown again and I actually have walnuts on it .

 There you go.

 Your idea of the broom handle works absolutely beautifully.

 There you go.

 So I thought I'd ring you with that one.

 Good.

 The other reason why I called was uh I think I spoke to you again last year about uh anything to keep wallabies off the off the roses and it started again this year you haven't come up with anything since the last time  we spoke apart from a bit of lead in their ear of course .

 Mm.

 Ooh that's a bit rough isn't it.

 Um what about what about getting some blood 'n' bone.

 Yeah.

 And putting some blood 'n' bone in a stocking.

 Ah.

 And hanging some blood 'n' bone in stockings around your roses.

 Okay.

 I do not believe they like the r the s the smell of the or the stench of rotting blood 'n' bone.

 Ooh I see that's worth a try. Uh.

 Mm. I'm not so crazy on it myself Greg but I suppose if it keeps the wallabies away .

 Well you could try that did I suggest to you that you try um spraying your roses with Seasol.

 No I do use a lotta Seasol in my gardening .

 Okay well there's another one. Um I I believe it works to a certain point that if you if you spray your roses with Seasol uh both possums and wallabies don't like the smell and the taste of the seaweed  okay but the only drawback is you've gotta regularly do that so you'd need to do it every mwah I'd say every week or thereabouts and ih c certainly after it's rained. But I would try that in or as a combination with the blood 'n' bone trick.

 I'll give that a try I tried a product last year that's uh well actually it's called Poss-Off  and that's got a chilli base I would suggest. When you're spraying it on it just about takes your breath away . But that didn't seem to work either  they they they .

 Kept the possums away but not the wallabies.

 Exactly .

 Well wuh uh it's a known fact that wallabies like roses with chilli.

 Oh absolutely yes . Uh they're of Mexican uh descent aren't they .

 Actually I'll just tell you a quick little one that was in the Reader's Digest this month that uh there's a a story that the bees are going on strike.

 Uh yes.

 Yes.

 More honey and uh what is it uh more more honey and shorter flowers .

 Oh okay. I like that thanks Peter have a great Christmas.

  thanks.

 Alright Leon good afternoon how are you. Hello Leon. Are you there. No we've lost Leon. Carol might like to try and get Leon back Kath hello Kath.

 Ah good afternoon.

 G'day Kath.

 Um last year I planted a Nelly Kelly passionfruit.

 Yeah.

 Lots of foliage lots of flowers. They all dutifully produced little babies.

 Mm.

 But they got to about the size of a large green olive they turned yellow and went soft.

 And there's nothing inside them.

 There's nothing inside them so I lost my temper with it.

 Mm.

 Cut it right back all I had left was stem I ignore that completely. I don't water it I don't feed it. It's covered in foliage it's starting to flower is it going to happen again.

 Yeah.

 So what's the what is the problem.

 Right well the deal with that Kath is that Nelly Kelly passionfruits are grafted  okay. Now what's happened is.

 Keep an eye on the um.

 On the suckers.

 On the suckers.

 Right but at some stage your plant has suckered and your graft has died and now all you're l you're left with is a sucker.

 Right the whole thing comes out  then .

 That's exactly right the whole things come comes out you've gotta buy yourself a new one  and then for the first twelve to eighteen months  every so often go out and just check the graft and make sure nothing's suckering from underneath and it should be fine.

 Oh goody I'll get one. 

 But that's what's wrong with it unfortunately.

 I'll go buy a new one next week.

 Mm hmm okay.

  it'll be my Christmas present. Thank you.

 Good on you  Kath have a nice Christmas. Leon we've got you back hello Leon.

 Oh good afternoon.

 Yes.

 I want to strike some petenia cuttings . Uh uh which is the best time of the year to take those.

 Right now Leon.

 Right now.

 Right now because the new growth from the Spring that goes really hot fiery red in colour  has hardened off . Now now's the time of the year to take the cuttings so  what you need to do is take your cuttings from the eastern side of the bush . And the reason for that is because all the carbohydrates are in the eastern sunny side of the bush  um take the b the c cuttings around about pen or pencil thickness . And around about in old terms three inches long.

 Okay yep.

 Alright. Strip the cutting back to two leaves at the top of the cutting . And then you can eih you can try two methods you can either dip your cuttings in uh a rooting gel. Don't buy the liquid or the powder buy the gel 'cos it's it's a better product these days so the rooting gel or you can dip the cuttings in some honey.

 I see yep yep.

 Yeah both of those will stimulate um root growth on your cuttings. They'll take around about oh around about four to six months to strike. So don't expect anything to happen within the four to six months. If for one reason or another the the cuttings start to flower then cut the flowers off  right . And um I would take if I were you uh how many do you want.

 Oh probably uh a dozen.

 Alright well take about forty cuttings . Okay 'cos you'll find that if you get ten out of forty cuttings then you're doing pretty well.

 Yeah I just wondering see I don't think my  cuttings that I would take would be as thick as you were saying uh.

 Well look try and take them as thick as you possibly can.

 And how uh rigid h how stiff are they actually.

 Oh at this  well at this time of the year 'cos that new growth has hardened off  right it's reasonably stiff.

 So you don't want the ones that are that you can virtually bend over.

 If you can wrap your finger around the stem and you get a little bit of resistance  right  then then they're ready to cut . Okay if they're really s uh uh s uh well they're sitting bolt upright 'n' they're very stiff then no you can't take them . You still want a little bit of flexibility in the cutting.

 Good yes and uh w dampness wuh how how damp do I keep them.

 Uh you make sure that your your propagation mix is moist  but never saturated okay and  not too dry. It's a really difficult one. You do need to water them every day. So I'd water them religiously every morning and then if we have an exceptionally dry day then you'll need to water them again.

 Just with a spray over the leaves.

 Uh yes but you wanna keep the mix wet not the leaves.

 Good okay then.

 Alright.

 Yes.

 Okay Leon.

 Good thanks very much.

 Thank you very much for your call it is nine minutes to three thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred the number to call.



 It's Trevor Jackson with Greg Kerrin for the last time this year by by the way uh for Gardening Talkback so your last chance to have a chat to Greg before we resume the program um uh towards the end of January next year. Bill from Moonah g'day Bill.

 Uh guh uh uh gentlemen.

 G'day Bill.

 What can we do for you Bill.

 I wanna kill something.

 Oh.

 Oh . That doesn't suh. Sounds a bit nasty.

  nextdoor neighbour and I have joined forces uh to get rid of the ivy on our fence which is tearing the fence down. What's the best stuff to.

 Mm.

 Vhoo.

 Wuh we've got the ivy out alright but of course it's roots everywhere.

 Ivy's tough very tough.

 'N' you've got a you got a coalition of uh  neighbours there Bill .

 They call you the ivy league .

 Um to kill ivy look um blackberry and tree killer  would be the best thing to use.

 Spray it on or paint it on.

 Tt uh uh have you got exposed stems. Or have you got foliage.

 I've got foliage galore  and also where we've been pulling it out there's it's rooted . I haven't got all the roots out.

 Okay um  I I would say for you the easiest thing to do would be to spray the foliage . Now please read the directions  when you purchase the blackberry tree killer and make sure that you follow all the precautions . It's most important um you will need to apply it more than once  maybe up to three or four times uh over three weeks  and that should knock the ivy back but be warned it's gunna come back again and yih it will take you probably twelve months to knock it off.

 Oh.

 So you're just gunna have to keep at it 'n' at it 'n' at it 'n' at it 'n' at it. It's one of those one of those pesty sort of weeds when it when it invades your garden to the extent that it has yours and your neighbour's you've just gotta keep at it all the time . One spray won't kill it.

 Okay.

 Alright  so just bear that in mind. But good luck that'll do it Bill.

 Thanks very much .

 Okay.

 Alright Bill.

 Thanks Bill.

 Okay have a great Christmas. Mm Iris. Good afternoon Iris.

 Hello.

 Yes how are things in Bridgewater this afternoon.

 Oh it's a bit chilly we've got a sea breeze.

 Oh. That's lovely uh the the the nice refreshing change to yesterday.

 Oh yes if only we'd get some rain.

 Yes.

  need it.

 It's been trying though all day.

 It has been. Yes my problem is I've mentioned to you before about soil wetting agents.

 Yes.

 Now when I put that on do I water my lawn first or do I just water the lawn with the the soil wetter and then put the hose on it.

 Are you which one are you using Iris.

 Well it's one that I mix in granules in a bucket 'n' then put it in a c watering can.

 And then water it on.

 Yeah.

 Okay. Well you don't need to water the lawn first  right. You only ih if you mixing it up with water  then just apply it  that way . Right there's no wat need to wet the lawn first because if you saturate the lawn or saturate the lawn before you you put your wetting agent down  um there's a good chance that it will flood all into one spot in the lawn  rather than getting an even distribution right across the lawn so just just use that uh uh mixture you've got in the watering can and apply it that way.

 And when do I water it afterwards with a sprinkler.

 No.

 No okay.

 No let it soak in Iris  and then tomorrow or the day after you can start watering again but you're gunna find that it will reduce your uh watering by about oh  three or four quarters.

 Oh that'll be lovely.

 Okay.

 Mm.

 Oh okay.

 Okay thank you very much.

 Alright Iris thank you very much for your call . And uh Greg uh who're we gunna pick as our winner this afternoon who should it be.

 Um well look I think Iris from Sandy Bay with her irises  that was just   a good question.

 Alright and just tickled your fancy just a little bit.

 Absolutely.

 Greg Kerrin uh from uh Carol and myself a big thankyou for your involvement in the program this year all of your uh participation and uh look forward to having you back next year you will come back won't you.

 I'll be back.

 Alright.
"
" A very good afternoon to you Roly.

 Good afternoon sir.

 Mm good to have you on board. Now Roly.

 I was I was listening with pleasure to to Tasmania taking things to W A in the cricket. That's heading in the right direction.

 Yeah well we're on top of the table at the moment. We've we had two outright victories so far which is  a great start although um they've certainly uh got a battle on their hands in this particular match.

 Yeah  but but there is I mean Americans call cricket baseball on valium and just don't understand it.

 Nah baseball's pretty slow. I've been to the baseball in America and it's it's not a fast game it can be pretty slow and you might only get three or four runs in the in an  entire game so.

 Whereas cricket has a certain measured elegance and then you get names like remember John Arlott and  and Alan McGilvray and the great commentators of the past uh I think uh allows one to appreciate things over several days which is not the sort of thing that you would find in any other sport nowadays.

 No there's certainly uh well al although cricket's losing that a little too but there's  certainly that gentile um factor that uh that that  comes into play there mm.

 Tea and cucumber sandwiches in the tent behind the village hall.

 Absolutely lovely  don't mind if  I do. Alright have you got a teaser for us.

 Yeah you'll like got you a stack of them actually. Some of these are quite easy but they're interesting if you don't happen to know them. What is the link between your salary and salt.

 Mm okay salary and salt alright the link  mkay m  mine's worth about a pound of it I think that's  the link in my case.

 Depends on the value of salt which  actually is part of the story as well.

 Okay.

 Ah last week someone asked about a Scouse phrase okeone or O K E O N E. Absolutely no trace of that I'm afraid I had drew a complete blank.

 Oh that's right O K E uh O N E.

 That's right  and it just didn't come up anywhere. Um on the other hand Jeff wanted to know about having a lend of someone or pulling someone's leg.  To have a lend of someone is recorded from the nineteen-tens uh Jonathan Green has it in the Cassells Dictionary of Slang and it means to treat someone like a fool. Um the pulling someone's leg is a nineteenth century story  and there are all sorts of variants. Apparently if you were a pickpocket and you wanted to um to  disrupt someone so that you could get at their pocket you might grab them by the leg and bring them down uh y'know alley thieves tripping people up so that they could rifle through their pockets.

 Sure.

 But this is is plausible it is it is not scientific fact and no one is entirely certain so I'm a I'm afraid I've got a an inconclusive answer there as well but that's how it came about  they reckon . I now have a question about tillies.

 Tillies.

 Mm uh the British in the fifties uh had a the army had a need for some cut down cars that could carry things from A to B so Austin Hillman and Singer there are names from the past for  you um made a sort of heavy duty pickup version of their of their sedans and these were called tillies from utility. Bit unusual because you take the s middle syllable of the word and put ies on the end  um but I have reports of tilly being used instead of ute in Australia and there are three pockets of tilly one of them is at Rockhampton Central Queensland second one is on the Darling Downs west of here from about Warwick Allora Dalby over the border down into Lismore  and there's another pocket of tillies in Hobart.

 Really.

 What I want to know is  do any of the listeners use tilly or have they used tilly in the past for utility do they still do so and can they give us place and time because this looks like an odd distribution. Certainly ute is winning hands down nowadays  but the tilly has been around in the past.

 You wonder how these little pockets emerge don't you I guess uh very strong uh English uh migration population .

 Possibly but I n I've got some references to tilly from Dalby in the thirties which is well before the Brits started. So maybe they picked up the term from Australian servicemen who were in Britain  and then proceeded to make their tillies  uh as while we were chopping off the backs of Holdens 'n' things and making utes.

 Could be.

 Right golf.

 Mm.

 You a golfer sir.

 Ah i ish yes I have played yes I I not regularly but I have yes.

 On a scale of one to ten that sounds like about two point seven.

  Yes it's  about that too. It's more for the  social aspect it's more for the beer afterwards I like what it leads to.

 Oh I see  you're a you're a nineteenth green person.

 Oh definitely yes.

 Okay well the name golf uh originally and often pronounced in Scottish English gowf G O W F  there’s even a n club in Ayrshire which calls itself a gowfclub G O W F  but uh one of the listeners got hold of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews  and uh asked them about golf 'n' when it was first ah noted  the there’s a Dutch word  cowf C O W F meaning club and so they think that that was where the the name from. In fourteen-fifty-seven James the Second banned golf 'n' football because people weren't doing their archery practice  please I like that.

 Yes.

 But some of the words from golf have odd histories. Link was the strip of land between the sea and agricultural land. So I suppose that was something that you could use for sporting purposes without disrupting either the fishermen or the farmers. Uh bogey comes from a mythical amateur golfer who was supposed to bogey things. Par  uh French and Latin word for average ah came into use round about eighteen-ninety-one. Birdies eagles and albatrosses. In the US who which took up golf with avidity  there was a phrase in the late nineteenth century a bird of a shot meaning a very good one and that's where they got birdie from and once you had one avian representative you also got eagles and albatrosses.

 Mm.

 A fore  is probably from the word forecaddie  who was someone who went ahead to mark the lie of the ball where the lord of the manor had uh mishit as it were.

 So he would yell  you would yell fore to the caddy to warn him.

 Well that's what happened later. But the forecaddie was someone who went fore  and um caddy is from French cadet C A D E T meaning young  the younger son joined the army and many caddies were ex army people looking for a job. So the caddy is someone who is younger and went around looking for the lie of the ball or later on carrying the clubs of milord. So golf has has a a a rather interesting and very well focused group of words which uh grew up over the years and uh the Royal and Ancient Club  St Andrews is now the home of golf as you know.

 Very rich heritage. Barry from Sandy Bay g'day Barry.

 Ah good afternoon gentlemen. Uh Roly a few weeks ago you were talking about the derivation of Australian nicknames uh  there's one common name that you don't  much these days but uh ih in when I was a youngster lots of men were called spoog or sproggy and they used to refer  to their children as their their sprogs uh  I think that it's parti uh peculiarly Australian it's as I I haven't uh come across it despite inquiry in uh Britain or or the States but I I had a couple of friends at school called sproggy.

 Yeah I remember that too  um there is a dialectal word sprag I think which means lively young man sort of something like that uh but I haven't heard that for y for a long time. Wh where did you go to school Barry.

 In Melbourne

 Melbourne okay so did I. So  Trevor did they use sprog in  New South Wales.

 Not in my time no not sproggy no or s uh sprog yes I heard sprogs but not sproggy no.

 Okay and to and to sprog was a verb oh you know someone sprogging means they're getti giving birth to.

 Oh okay okay.

 So yeah thank you for reminding me Barry I'll see if I can find a bit more but the dictionary last time I checked said orig uncert  which means they don't know where it came from.

 Ok Barry  thank you for your call  Barry's gone obviously. Anne from Garden River g'day Anne.

 Um good afternoon gentlemen um tilly.

 Yes.

 Uh I was in the Wrens oh a long time ago and if ever we were to go out uh uh to sort of see something special you know just a a small group of us  we would get in a tilly van.

 Uh it was called a tilly van.

 Tilly van yes.

 Okay date roughly when.

 Oh date um I’ll have to do some mathematics hang on um forty years ago.

 Okay mm minus forty this is interesting and what can you tell us what a tilly van was like.

 Well it was just like a small bus really um  I think it seats about  oh twenty people  twentyish people maybe thirty but it was like a small bus.

 And this was in England.

 In England yes.

 Mm which part of.

 Uh uh  w w w what where I was in the navy was in the south.

 Mhm okay  because sometimes these things are fairly local this sounds as if they've picked up the word tilly from the earlier use in the fifties  and then extended it to apply to a particular sort of ah additional type of vehicle like a van.

 Mm it was a Naval  airbase I remember that.

 Naval airbase . South Hampton or someplace .

  H M S Gamecock I remember that much but I I just truly can't remember where it was I wasn't really happy at the time um  so memories didn't s sort of cling.

 I'll be able to find out about the Gamecock because there's a very nice Royal Navy website which has all of these things on it.

 Uhuh well Gamecock  was the was the ah name of the place and sprog that comes from England I think too because it was like a uh uh um  not a very nice name for s for a child you know  a derogatory sort of uh uh title for a child.

 Yes we used to use it in Melbourne I I heard it when I was living in New Zealand and  I've also I'm certain heard it in London  . It was s slightly disreputable you know it sort of.

 That's right that's right  .

 If there was actually .

 You know someone might be giving birth in an upper-class hospital but they were sprogging away   if they had a midwife or something yeah.

 Yeah yeah.

 Thank you Anne.

 Thank you.

 Of course you were never referred to as a sprog were you Roly.

 Uh probably  I was referred to as lots of things.

  Sixteen minutes to three on nine-three-six A B C Hobart Trevor Jackson with Roly Sussex this afternoon Lance from West Hobart g'day Lance.

 Hello Trevor hello Roly.

 Hello there.

 Hello.

 Uh Roly I come from a generation where salt was still put into the cellars the s and the little spoons and one of my jobs to get pocket money was once a week I had to roll the ah heavy salt with a glass rolling pin and they added corn flour  to it  in those days somebody worked their bloody guts out was called worth their salt which I think  could be from the old word salarium meaning salary eh.

 You got the whole thing.

 Nah.

  .

 With one small little bit left out the Roman soldiers used to be paid in salt  and that was  that's right 'n' that was where the uh the orig word the word originally came from and salt was a commodity which was very expensive and worthwhile.

 Yeah that's why you  sat be you sat below or above the salt  if you were worth the money you were above the salt and uh but I can remember once that uh  at the Governor General's residence seeing salt cellar and little s uh I'm sorry uh  uh what's the word cru cruet sets for every  person in front of them so there'd be no ab absolutely no way that anybody feel out of uh according.

 Out of place  because if you were above the salt the salt was in the middle of the table 'n' milord and so were sat on one side and the and the underlings to the other. But you're dead right about salt and it w wasn't I think until the nineteenth century when they found out ways of making salt in large quantities cheaply that it became less valuable than it had been before.

 I I I've got this funny idea but we had to earn our X amount per week. It was sixpence to go to the pictures then you had to have your money for your bubblegum and your pence  for the icecream but one of the other things I had to do was to mix up the whiting and do the front stairs.

 Oh okay.

 Oh yes . Now that's another  another task that has now sinh  long since gone.

 There's other people who more than likely have better stories  than that .

  Oh no this ih this is good stuff.

 Thank you very much.

 No its great Lance  thank you Lance. Thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is the number. Yes young people don't know how good they've got it today Roly do they.

 They don't they don't. Trevor I've another one. What is the connection between pollution and malaria.

 Pollution and malaria  okay. Pollution and malaria. That's Roly's second teasier teaser for this afternoon. If you think you know it thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred. Pauline from Kingston hello Pauline.

 Oh good afternoon gentlemen. Um it was just you talking about sprogs. My husband was in the Royal Navy in the late fifties and early sixties about the time that Queen Elizabeth was having her second family and they used it slightly derogatory when they sort of spliced the main brace after  um she gave birth they got extra tots of rum but they weren't very you know polite about the sprog but that's what they said you know   they used .

 Okay thank you  sprog in the navy.

 You know navy from  they were down the South Coast they were based down at Portsmouth or Plymouth  mm  okay.

 Thank you for sprog.

 Alright Pauline. No thank you very much . John John from Mornington hello John.

 Hello. Um sproggy. Um  I heard it used in the late forties early fifties uh by a person from South Australia referring to a sparrow uh sorry a starling.

 Oh  mm alright we don't have starlings up here. I shall have to do a little bit of work on this one.

 Starlings  everywhere except for Western Australia.

 Yeah well they may be but not not where I live . Um starling spadger sparrow mm alright thank you f I I've going to have to do a bit of homework on that one.

 Mm.

 Alright John. Thrown a bit of a spanner in Roly's works that's good to see .

 Okay.

 Thank you Trevor.

 Keep the man on his toes  thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred for language talkback Alan from Midway Point. G'day Alan.

 Uh the malaria means bad air whi which they thought it might be caused by bad air before they found out what caused it.

 That's before anopheles was discovered yep you're dead right particularly the swamps of ancient Rome and such places which were apparently very good  as uh  places where malaria would grow so mal aria is Latin or in Italian actually .

 Bad air.

 Bad air.

 Well done. Thank you Alan.

 That was a bit of of medical bad diagnosis.

  Thanks Alan thanks for the call. Have you got a another teaser Roly.

 Alright what's a link . This one is a bit more obscure. The link between typhoid and smoking.

 Typhoid and smoking alright.

 Mhm.

 Okay. This is fun I like this. Thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred  is the number if you've got uh an inkling of what uh Roly's teaser might be the link between typhoid and smoking.



 Trevor Jackson with Roly Sussex this afternoon on nine-three-six A B C Hobart thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is the number. Roly a scholar and a gentleman.

 Yes and my thanks to Neil Kurtz from Rose Bay in Tasmania  who sent me some very interesting information. Um Burns had it round the other way a gentleman and scholar and his poem The Twa Dogs two dogs  Wordsworth in The Prelude had scholars and gentlemen and Partridge in his Dictionary of Catchphrases  has this lovely phrase a gentleman and a scholar and a fine judge of whiskey.  A good man.  And C C Colton a man I didn't know about in a um poem called Lacon uh has the phrase a gentleman by nature and a scholar by education  and one of my listeners has sent me a a lovely story from Punch the alas defunct magazine a uh officer turns up at a hotel  announces himself at the reception desk and the receptionist rings up to a young lady  and says there's a scholar and a gentleman for you madam and she says send them both up.

  Fair enough. Colin from Lauderdale. G'day Colin.

 Yeah good afternoon uh both of you. Uh the word  sprog recalls some distant memories. Um in the late fifties middle late fifties I was doing National Service in the in the R A F in Britain  and sprog was commonly used then to mean someone who'd just arrived to start their service in other words they hadn't done very much at this point they were very green and uh the new guys were sprogs.

 Okay that one I didn't know and this was the R A F.

 The R A F yes National Service  Britain late fifties.

 Seems to be very common the armed services doesn't it.

 But n yeah but nev.

 It does indeed.

 I never I've never heard sproggy. It was always a sprog a new sprog.

 Yeah the sproggy bit mm unless it means starling which I'm going to have to find out about. Um do you happen to know whether it was used in the other services.

 No I don't  no  I can only comment it from my own experience which was Royal Airforce Britain  late fifties.

 Gradually getting a picture of it though thank you  very much.

 Thank you Colin.

 Good-o .

 Okay.

 Bye.

 Now Roly you want to talk about hyphens today as well.

 I'm I'm absolutely burning up to talk about hyphens  yes . Um a  a listener in South Australia said look we've got antemeridian which is one word but post-meridian which is hyphenated and you've got anti-establishment which is hyphenated but antidisestablishmentarianism which is not. What's going on. Ah in times like this turn to Pam Peters's lovely book Australian English Style Guide  and what follows is is largely taken from her. There are three levels of combining words you can have them totally separate you can have them hyphenated or they can be joined. And on the whole the Americans join things and on the whole the Brits tend not to and half-way house is a hyphen. Generally speaking if a word oh sorry if two words come together and create something which now has a new meaning like runoff as of rain  then it will be written as one word. But lots of others  are hyphenated and the question is when. Well first of all if you get to the end of a line and there's no room for what you want to write you do a hyphen  and the rule is generally break before one consonant between two and after  one and before the next two I think that's right. I have to think about that one. Occasionally  you need a hyphen to separate meanings like re-cover and recover  right you wouldn't want to get those two mixed up so the hyphen actually emphasises that the re is to be added to the meaning of cover  rather than to form a new word recover which is now a meaning on its own. You can have prefixes and roots like counter-terrorist hyphenated you can have root plus root doorjamb and you can have roots joined up which don't actually stand on their own like agri doesn't stand by its own but agribusiness one word  is okay. There are a couple of odd things um  if you've got a word which includes some different typography in other words something like um F B T for Fringe Benefit Tax uh then if you are anti-F B T you'd be anti hyphen F B T you wouldn't  want to mix lower case and upper case in the one word.

 Mm

 But then you got co and ex. If the C O words are old like coexist they're one word. If they're newer like co-author they tend to be hyphenated. This is getting worse 'n' worse 'n' worse. And if you have a verb like to babysit that tends to be one word  but sometimes hyphenated but if you've got a babysitter that's almost always one word. Not baby hyphen sitter but babysitter.

 So do you think the newer words uh have the hyphens simply because or or  the older words don't simply because we've been writing them so long we get a little bit lazy and we just end up joining them.

 It's not so much lazy as I think they've established themselves as having a particular meaning which is not just the joining of the two bits  but for example amoral is not just non moral but it suggests some certain sorts of behaviour which cluster together  and so amoral is taken as a piece and you don't think of it as being compositional or made up of two separate bits . And uh whereas uh more recent words which have been coined and are sitting there like gift-wrap for example  that's fairly recent and so that is hyphenated  barefoot has been around for a long long time and so that's one word  um open-door policy open hyphen door policy I would've thought um and sometimes if you get a phrase which is used always in the same way like an equal opportunity employer you just write the words separately. So there are a  there are some regularities for example editor-in-chief that would always be hyphens mother-in-law is always hyphens but notice that the modifiers the in chief and in law actually follow. So I do recommend either the A G P S Style Guide that's the Australian Government Publishing Service  or Pam Peters uh on the um uh Australian English Usage or if you like dear old Fowler. Now they all talk about this and the answer to the question is no when not when do I use a hyphen is um there are some cases which are two le two words there are some which are one word 'n' there are lots which are vacillating in between with hyphens.

  Indeed.

 Sorry to be indecisive . In hyphen decisive.

 Roger from Lindisfarne. G'day Roger.

 G'day. Just to fill you in on the sprogs  the British army nineteen-fifties early sixties certainly used  that term for ru recruits.

 New recruits yes.

 Yep so  that  helps to pad out the picture for you.

 Indeed so we now have army and airforce navy people please pick up the phone.

  Okay.

 Okay goodbye.

 Alright thank you Roger  yes and uh Carol's just given me a message uh Roly that someone else from the armed forces has uh phoned the A B C switchboard ah from Portsmouth to say that yeah  sprog same thing. Leon from uh.

 Portsmouth England or Portsmouth Tasmania.

  Portsmouth Tasmania  . England . There you go. I've just got a nod of the head there. Okay Leon good afternoon. Leon who's not from Portsmouth hello Leon are you there. No we don't seem to have Leon Carol you might try 'n' see if we can get Leon back. Uh yes it's gunna be very interesting you've started something with sprog now haven't you.

 Well yes it wasn't entirely me either. And off we go. Uh tillies people. Surely someone must use tilly in Tasmania.

 Yes um we haven't had uh we only had uh from the the lady who was in stationed in in England at the time .

 That's right and forget not typhoid and smoke  I want to know about the link.

 You're a you're absolutely certain that tillies was used here.

 Oh yeah  and uh I I listeners being absolutely certain and collaborating each sh corroborating each other uh are these three little pockets Rockhampton the Darling Downs and Hobart.

 Mm okay thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is our number you wanna be quick 'cos we've only got a little bit of time left on the program this afternoon uh any more homework Roly.

 Uh not really I think the there there oh yeah I've got a couple of bits. Um Osheania  Oseania  Osheana  um there's a word foliage which tends to come out as folage   not with Peter Cundell but then he's A B C and Tasmania so he'd get it right but Oseania  has been coming out as Oseana this is the soccer stuff recently. Um yeah it seems to be hard to say and there are a few other  other examples of it as well. Ah another little bit that I picked up the the term master and slave which is used in computer um speak for a particular type of typology of networks is now no longer kosher in Tasmania. Uh the words uh have unfortunate associations and the computer geeks have gotta find something else.

  Fair enough. Jim from Glenorchy.

 Oh g well . I'm ringing up about the Tilley. It's not  not the ute but we used to use Tilley lanterns when we went camping.

 Ah yeah that's a different Tilley that's a a maker's name for those kerosene pressure lanterns.

 Oh right yeah yeah  oh well yeah I just thought they might've been you know like in the old days where you went  out on manoeuvres in the in the little ute or  whatever the tilly ute and used a Tilley lamp.

 Uh right uh it's a good idea but I'm afraid  in this case  it doesn't work.

 I'm off the track.

  Alright Jim.

 Rightio . 

 Yes  .

 Okay  uh thirteen-hundred-thirty-six-seventeen-hundred is our number. Tilly well no takers on that perhaps by the program next week we might hear from that. Uh if you've missed any s any particular aspect of the program today W W W dot A B C dot net dot A U uh slash uh Hobart tt and uh just check the links through the afternoon program and you will find uh today's language talkback session. Now Roly you do have a last word for us today before we go.

 Yes there was a piece in the Brisbane Courier Mail which said the emotion over the decision that's giving Sachin Tendulkar out will louden the call for further technology . And one of the listeners has sent me a poem.

 

 Thanks to Ray Kelly .

  . And thanks y thank you Roly Sussex.

"
" Hello and welcome to the Chatroom with Gaby tonight. It is world Refugee Day and we've never talked about refugee situations in The Chatroom before and I know there's a lotta passion around this issue. So give us a call one-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six. I wanna hear from you if you have an opinion on the refugee situation  or if you took part in any Refugee Day rallies or activities  if you are a refugee say on a uh temporary protection visa or if you were a refugee who's been granted residency that sort of thing uh if you agree  with the government's handling of the situation. There's a lot of um a lotta push t I I guess a lot of uh talk about not agreeing with the government's situa uh handling of the situation but if you agree  also wanna hear from you tonight. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six what are your concerns. It is the first time that we've discussed refugees in The Chatroom. So let's have some some interesting debate and discussion tonight okay. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six give us a call and here's just a brief overview of what it was all about today. Or perhaps not. Oh yes .



 Give us a call one-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six let's talk about it. Language warning on this tune to get us started.



 That's called Seventy-Seven Per Cent by The Herd on Triple J.



 One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six tonight. It's world th Refugee Day. I keep going to say World Environment Day. I don't know why it's just stuck in my head. It's World Refugee Day today and so we're just gunna open up the phones tonight and talk about that we've never discussed um the refugee issue on this program so I'm quite looking forward to hearing what you have to say tonight. Let's catch up first with Ben in Melbourne hello Ben.

 Hey.

 Hi. Now you were at the uh Melbourne rally today. 

 Yeah yeah. It was uh it was really good it was outside the exhibition building  uh near the IMAX. Um  I'm not too oh I'm pretty sure most of you might know Aladin Sisalem the guy who was detained on uh Manus Island. Was um he came 'n' gave a speech to everyone 'n' thanked everyone for the support and he y'know thanked the Refugee Action Collective and everyone who's uh been more or less sympathetic to the whole situation and uh y'know there's many more people like him in this situation but  it was actually it was quite moving.

 Okay. I'm not actually familiar with what his situation is now. Is he on a temporary  protection visa d'you know.

 I assume so  he's well he's got residency in Australia but um  he was the last guy left on uh Manus Island and it was him and a cat.

 Oh wow.

 And uh he's asked them to find the cat except they haven't been able to find it recently so.

 Okay.

 Alright.

 I guess if that's your only companion you you'd be um fairly concerned for its welfare I imagine.

 Uh yeah .

 Yeah . Um so so were you uh I mean are you passionate about this Ben obviously you've  come to the rally you must be.

 Yeah um  uh I was on the T V .

 You were .

 Yeah I was on A B C . So um  no it was  I've been waiting for  something like this for a while and I think there should have been a better turnout personally.

 Okay.

 But um no what happened was we uh marched from there down to um  uh Fitzroy town hall . There was a  a festival for the World Refugee Day . So it was all happening there and y'know all the contingents kinda sorta met up there and y'know like I didn't I didn't end up staying for the rest of it 'cos me brother tried to drag me home so  uh and I had a bit of work to do. But it was um no it was it was good to see everyone's kinda y'know people actually give a shit .

 Yeah. Lotta young people.

 Um yeah yeah and or young and old it was it's uh it's good because uh y'know I've  I think have had this sort of view of the old people being y'know rather sort of bent up conservative sort of people y'know what I mean.

 Mhm mhm.

 But I  y'know  . Pretty sceptical about that.

 Okay. Alright well thanks for your call Ben. Thanks for  telling us how it all  went. See ya. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six. Let's talk to Tony in Sydney hi Tony.

 Hi how are you.

 I'm well thank you. Now you're in two minds about this issue.

 Yeah I am of two minds um. I suppose the first thing is  it's very important that um people who are genuine refugees have the opportunity to live in a safe and comfortable environment. But at the same time too I think we have to be very concerned about our own security. Um and be mindful of that so I I I think that um it sometimes does take time. But genuine refugees do eventually have the opportunity to uh prove their case. And I think that's exactly what um our government is trying to prove at the moment . And I suppose that's just where I sit at the moment.

 When you say um you're concerned about our security do you wanna elaborate on that a bit more.

 Um  well I I don't think there's too many of us who actually know enough about Australian security . So I suppose it's difficult for everyone. Whether it's someone who's conservative like myself or it's someone who is very um concerned about uh refugees' uh right to have freedom and they wanna see those people who have come to Australia a vih as refugees  released into community as as quickly as possible and and that's something that I'm just of two minds about  um.

 So you're  happy that it takes a little bit of time to kinda sort out.

 Uh well  I suppose I'm not happy that it does take time but I am happy that that those people who have spent that time  have been proven to be be genuinely in need of help and are now currently living in Australia as free citih uh as as as people who are uh ih ih receiving help from us.

 Mhm.

 I I don't think we all have enough information  to  y'know to sorta say y'know that things are up and up and uh I I just don't know where we stand at the moment it's it's it's something I don't understand and it's something that concerns me 'cos I don't have enough information given to me.

 Okay. Hmm oh alright . Yes  it's a bit of a hmm isn't it.

 Yes it is.

 Yeah alright Tony well thanks very much  for your call.

 No no no worries cheers bye.

 Okay bye. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six if you'd like to uh contribute tonight. Let's talk to Tim in Parramatta in Sydney hi Tim.

 Hi.

 Now what do you think about all this.

 Um I think it stands as a testament to what abysmal act or racism this is when even people like John Valder who was a former president of the Liberal party um people like Andrew Wilkie who was an inteh intelligence offr  I think in the highest level of security in Australia are basically turning against Howard on this. Uh when people who are in reasonably prominent positions um even in the Liberal party itself are saying that this policy is  well  wrong I guess. Um y'know it sort of shows how problematic and how bad it actually is.

 So it's causing division within the ranks.

 Yeah it's certainly causing division within the ranks I think. Um not as much as it would have. Howard as the prime minister has probably got more power than any prime minister in hih Australian history. Um certainly in controlling his own party and the public service. But even then people are turning against him people are speaking out.

 Mhm.

 Um. And I just uh.

 So you you obviously think that the that his policies are are are not  right.

 Well I can't I can't understand his motivation other than say on being purely sadistic. Um if he was concerned about defence for instance which a lot of people seem to claim he is  he would have to reform the system because um there was a case a while ago where a suspected war criminal actually got into the country  um and wasn't found for something like fourteen months. Um he pr I would assume that he bribed his way though given that the actual procedure for checking whether someone is a legitimate refugee or whatever is basically down to one person there are no checks and balances. To that side say this person just took off with um whatever money he could from the country and um basically gave a golden handshake to the person checking him.

 Oh okay.

 So if say Al Qaeda or another terrorist organisation with some degree of funding  well actually Al Qaeda is a funding network not a terrorist organisation so a terrorist organisation connected to Al Qaeda  wanted to infiltrate Australia  as a refugee they would have n um well other than obviously getting on a plane 'n' flying over here with a fake visa which is still much easier  um they would probably find it reasonably easy just to simply enter a detention centre and then bribe their way through. Um because there is no checks and balances on the program there is no  journalists aren't allowed to go inside the camps um no-one really knows what's going on or well people know roughly what's going on but it's trying to be hushed up from a defeh um from point of view of defence it's abysmal.

 Do you think that someone would actually accept a bribe to let someone  through who who wasn't a genuine refugee.

 Of course um  well if if there's no  if there's no way to um catch them. Well a person actually did a person let a suspected war criminal in. And this is this is something that you would at least assume the government the government and the organisations involved would know about. Um the World Court admittedly is quite  mal ill-equipped due to sort of other problems which would probably be um best deal with another time  but even so some they should be able to find out hang on we've got a suspected war criminal um in our midst y'know . So if they can't if they can't find say someone who's suspected of well crimes against humanity  et cetera in um a refugee camp what chance do they have of finding someone who might be connected to a terrorist terrorist organisation.

 So Howard should address that.

 Um how you ih . Basic basically introduce what should be happening with the public service in this country and  have um greater transparency greater checks and balances.

 Okay . To to to stop that sorta thing happening.

 Yeah well  that shouldn've happened to prevent any problems from happening anything from um someone who someone from coming into the country who shouldn't come in to um maltreatment of the refugees overmedih um overprescription of medication which  was quite a big issue on a Four Corners program. Um violence 'n' beating of refugees I've heard quite a few cases of . Um mal not them not being fed en anything basically  we need to be able to check and find out what's going on.

 Okay. Yeah be interesting to uh to to really get in and and see what is happening. Jim  thanks for your call.

 Not a problem.

 See you later . One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six. Give us a call if you'd like to comment on what uh Tim Tony or Ben have said uh tonight or if you'd like to offer your own opinion.



 Well it's gunna be so exciting isn't it hang on to the seat of your pants Queensland. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six.



 That's right we're talking about uh World Refugee Day today and uh getting some different opinions and that sort of thing. If you're uh if you are a refugee on a uh T P V temporary prodect protection visa or if you were a refugee who's been granted residency. And we'll hear from uh someone who has been granted residency little later on in the show  who spoke to Steve Cannane. Uh I'd love to hear from you tonight give us a call uh ih of of course if you agree with the government's handling of the refugee uh situation or if you disagree with it then give us a call. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six trying to get to as many calls tonight as possible. Let's talk to Steven in Tullington hi Steven.

 Hi there thanks um yeah uh uh look it was just terrific today um I visit someone in Villawood um Atta Zahidi who's uh uh a great uh bloke he's Iranian young chap uh he's been stuck in Villawood for fourteen months y'know he still manages to keep his spirits up somehow but um y'know this is just. And y'know theh the people are charged y'know when they leave um when they're finally found to be legitimate refugees. I mean this is ap an appalling thing that didn't even happen in the Second World War. I mean my father came from Austria during the Second World War went to New Zealand. Never stent wuh never spent one miserable day in detention. Y'know  and the the world was a far more dangerous place in in uh nineteen y'know forty than it wuh is in uh two-thousand-and-four. Believe me I mean you you'd know  uh also but um  y'know people are wrecked in detention. And it's not time to  there was a bloke who called in earlier on who's sorta vacillating y'know might be a good idea might not be a good idea not really sure well it's time for him to go to Villawood. And you can visit people in Villawood there's no restriction it's a bit of a wait it's terribly inefficient and uh people are not that polite but um y'know you can meet people 'n' you can find out the truth. There's no I don't really think there's a much of an excuse for people not to know what's going on . Um there was a fabulous program on this morning  uh it was on Radio National it was um Background Briefing repeated at seven P M on on or ten past seven P M on uh t on Tuesday. Uh brilliant program guh it was saying how how the whole thing is set up with the private companies and  who's making the money and what people go through  and about those  recent the HREOC report 'n' stuff. There was it was  very very guh uh mm um tt Tom Morton put the thing together brilliant um Background Briefing yeah.

 Oh okay.

 And um. Look . We've gotta leap a as I say leap ahead make sure this can never happen again in our history. It's just  it it it's just not something that a civilised countr country does y'know. Lock up people throw away the key not charge them not do anything. In theory I mean not in theory but the f the courts have said yeah we can keep someone in in detention for the rest of their lives . If we're not prepared to send them back to I mean the bloke I visit in Villawood  uh uh I mean he's got this constant threat of being s uh sent back to Iran . Which is  which is awful it's not a very nice regime. Uh.

 Is it must be very difficult to live in that environment and not know not be able to make any plans for your  future.

 Well well that that's right I mean he does manage to keep his his spirits up uh or or put a good face on that which have which which um in the end I think can't be sustained but y'know full marks for him for being  y'know so so uh  uh y'know.

 Steven how is it that you came to start visiting someone in the Villawood detention centre.

 Um. Uh I I visited um a fair while ago I think it was um a friend 'cos before Hassan there was Aamer Sultan who's who's now free . Who did that fantastic report with a bloke called um uh uh um a bloke called Zachary Steel on the um he was a doctor um on the effects of detention on women and children . And uh  that was a while back I I'm not sure how I  I must have gone with someone else I went to see the outside of it with a friend and it was so shocking. If you don't wanna actually visit someone inside the uh inside Villawood go and have a look at the outside of it  and that will tell you enough that will tell you  a lot that you need to know . Just the just the size of it.

 Yeah I've got.

 And that should be uh that should've been on the front page of the Herald this morning. You know a picture of that. That it was Refugee Day today. And I don't think to be honest with you I I I think y'know Background Briefing was fantastic but I don't think the A B C had enough about it and I don't think the Herald had enough about it and I don't think the Australian had enough about it. I think the the mainstream media have been  um h have not  to put it mildly have not done their job on this one . They've bought into the government um y'know propaganda big time.

 I had a look at the papers this morning um Steven and I uh to be honest I couldn't really find it much about it at all . Um and I I had a bit of a look at uh I I played actually an excerpt from the A B C news at the start of the show  which um which gave uh a report on on what was going on and the  um the sailors that went to Nauru but it was strange the the sort of  lack of coverage I had expected  more.

 If I can say it's something like I I I grew up in England actually as you can probably tell and my father came was a refugee went to New Zealand and then  actually la uh wound up in England and like I used to wonder what it was like in the Third Reich in Germany and Austria  y'know with the things that were happening  what were the newspapers doing . And now I know what the newspapers were doing. The newspapers were doing there  during the rise of when Hitler was in power what they were doing here they were ig ignoring the abuses of power. Now there they had an excuse. In Germany they had an excuse. I'd love to know what the excuse is here . From the editors of the major papers. Maybe they're saying oh people don't want to read about that. But I think if they put stuff if they were brave  people would read it y'know and for them they had the the passion in it. And I think we folk need to put all the pressure we can on the Labor party who hopefully will get in not because I love the Labor party but because I think they're a  a slightly better alternative we  need to loh uh wuh we need to light a f get rid of Howard and light a fire under Latham.

 Mhm.

 For sure that's what we 'n' really keep the pressure on. And if there's ever a uh uh look. Y'know l like when I first came to Australia like peop uh my relatives said y'know what Australians are really aren't political. And I think that's sort of currently true I mean it's same as  it's uh actually the same in Britain to a large extent  but I think y'know this is what happens when you're not political when you're uh don't really care about people . I'm sorry to s say that 'n' I'm 'n' I'm  and and and and theh and there are some gr fan the the the activists I've met here are the best y'know . And on the East Timor front all sorts of  but I uh y'know people at large  they really need to care in that sort of trying to see the big picture . Not just care about their family and friends that's fine that's everyone does that  hopefully but y'know um the  the the the big picture and get  active even if it's just writing a letter just to start off with. Just do something  just um  it is a h it's whole lotta fun I have to say . And uh y'know full marks I say to um to uh Merlin uh uh Luck who's just made a s a superb example . He's just wuh I I just take my hat off.

 He's really brought it uh into the limelight hasn't he. Steven thanks very much for your call it's been uh terrific  'n' see you later.

 All the best.

 Okay bye. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six I knew we'd uh get some passionate responses tonight let's talk to Theo in Melbourne Theo how you going.

 Great Gaby and yourself.

 Yeah not too bad thank you.

 Great stuff look tonight's a great topic because hey everybody gets to voice something and Triple J let's it happen. I just wanna say that uh I agree with that other caller about um refugees having to stay where they are temporarily. Whether it takes a year or two years hey it's a normal process of y'know going through checking out who it is that's the refugee or  y'know what their background is like. Because when you wanna visit a country these these days they've gotta actually know who you are. So all these refugees have come over from uh another country fair enough they have their own r reasons but we can't just willy nilly let 'em in because we don't know what their backgrounds are.

 Mhm.

 So y'know it's um I totally agree with what's going on. Only as well because  y'know they've gotta just basically check who they are and I don't think it's as bad as the papers make it out to be in in uh um in basically where they are where where they've  where they've uh got 'em uh temporarily. I agree that it's y'know probably poor conditions but I don't think that they're actually being treated bad. 'Cos the government wouldn't let it happen . They'd look bad they'd really look bad. So by having them and having the papers and having people just battling it out trying to get 'em outta there the government's actually saying hang on y'know let's um uh y'know let's see who we're leavih leaving y'know come into the country. So I think that yes it's it's right what's going on. I don't know the whole inside and outs of course 'cos we don't know what is true and what isn't true . The government does a few things good in uh in our lives I guess and this is one of 'em.

 So do you feel that you feel that it's uh as a security issue it's it's y'know it ih it so it doesn't  what I'm trying to say is it's it's cool for y'know that uh to be detained for as long as it takes basically to suss out your background and all that kinda thing whether that's y'know a couple of months or a couple of years or or whatever.

 Well the thing is if you d if you don't wanna be detained I guess you can ask them hey I'll go back to my country  I'll leave y'know a letter saying here that I wanna come back as a refugee. They may not have anywhere to go but if they wanted to stay in Australia I guess they could just y'know wear it out I mean they're reading I I I'm assuming they'd be eating guaranteed I mean they're all alive. So they'd be all eating they'd be drinking. But there's a process they'd be waiting for that has to basically happen and that is let's see what their backgrounds are. Who are they. Y'know we we can't let uh for example billionaires into the country or murderers into the country we don't know what they'll do.

 Mm mm tt.

 So  y'know I I I agree with what's going on if if um and letting this happen tonight by Triple J letting this happen tonight it's great 'cos all you hear is refugees are y'know being treated bad being treated badly that's all you hear on the radio you never get anyone saying y'know s the opposite end of the conversation I guess.

 Mm mm.

 So. 

  I'm really pleased that um that we're getting a variety of opinion tonight because as I think that's that's really valuable for the debate on this y'know n n no-one uh what's right and what's wrong is is totally arbitrary y'know and and  that's that's what I I love actually about just being able to open up the phones and go hey what do you think. Just ring us and tell us and it y'know it doesn't matter if it's for against or or whatever. All the opinions are valid definitely.

 Well that's see that's that's great stuff I mean look if you get other callers like myself for example who agree with what's going on hey you'll know at least that there is some other people out there thinking there's a reason for this going on . Y'know there's ih we just don't let 'em in there willy nilly and throw 'em in there and don't feed 'em or don't do anything like everybody else is saying. They're in there they're eating they have to wait for their process. I have to wait for my process for something else I guess they'll have to wait for that.

 Mm okay then. Theo thanks very much for ringing.

 Great stuff thanks Gaby.

 See you later.

 See you.

 Bye. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six give us a call with your opinion tonight on The Chatroom. Hey I um popped down to the the um World Refugee Day rally in Sydney today and um I caught up with uh what was her name. Ruth Radcliffe was the lady's name. She was one of the organisers of today's rally in uh Sydney and um I asked her how she felt about how it all went down.



 On Triple J outta Scotland that's Idlewild. A Modern Way of Letting Go and Tonjip as well with Coolite just before that.



 One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six tonight it's World Refugee Day and we're talking about that a range of opinions it's great to uh  to to hear from you tonight especially since this is the first time we've sorta broached this uh topic in The Chatroom. Very much looking forward to what we have uh to say for the rest of the night let's talk to Britney in Sydney hi Britney.

 Hi.

 Now what would you like to say tonight.

 Um I'd just like to talk about how um I live in the western suburbs of Sydney and I go to a fairly what right wing school and I was trying to like encourage some of my friends to come to the the march at Sydney today and uh they were like y'know I'm like hey come to the wuh y'know the march about refugees and they were like  what are you talking about there's no there's y'know there's like they'd rather not be interested in it at all right they they'd rather be y'know remain y'know ignorant about the situation that's going on they'd rather not be involved and it's just y'know it really makes me really quite angry because I think there was only two or three people that were really interested in coming. And I was like y'know this is like why cah why can't the people y'know the youth of today especially people out in the western suburbs remain ignorant of y'know stuff that's going on y'know which they should be getting involved.

 Why do you think the ignorance is there.

 Um because I think they just  because they're so sheltered like out where I live like they're so sheltered they'd much rather not become involved like it's just it's just obviously too hard for them they just don't feel like they can make a difference . And it's just like um  y'know it's like I did the same thing for the anti-war protest I was like yeah let's go student strike. And all my friends were like the war's okay y'know like and I'm like I was like really quite angry because they didn't really have any s they didn't most of them didn't have even have an opinion.

 Oh okay. See I reckon y'know  you can be either way on an issue but I reckon it's really important to have an opinion to be honest.

 Yeah it's like it makes me quite angry because like like there's just it's just people will be like well y'know if the government's saying it's okay it's okay.

 Mhm.

 And that can't that just makes me 'cos you just suh if you don't have an opinion  y'know you don't you don't really have a voice and you just it's so important that y'know people my age like people of the school like y'know it's just have a voice because y'know it's just it's so important.

 So if they did have a strong opinion about it but it was contrary to yours.

 Yeah.

 You you'd respect that.

 Of course I respect it  but I I just think it it's just I think it's just an imph uh I think it's just an importuh important to res  important to have  sorry uh. Duh uh important yeah important to have an opinion.

 How is it that you've um you've you've sort of stumbled onto this and and become passionate about these issues.

 Um well I live also in Redfern 'cos um my parents have live in separate suburbs and um I also live in Redfern so I often y'know I just  like I I don't I just see it as a kind of  my dad is also very passionate about it and he's just y'know he's just I've become y'know I've seen people come around and talk about y'know how  how y'know I just I dunno I just become really passionate about y'know just a lot of people I know like y'know talked about their friends ab who have been in um y'know refugee detention centres and stuff and I was just talking about how incredibly y'know how how mean they can be y'know it's just like they completely ignore y'know hunger strikes and stuff like that and it's just how can you how can you y'know ignore that sorta stuff.

 So what would you do perhaps to um to encourage your friends to to form an opinion.

 Oh I just I just  basically tell them that they're stupid  if they don't have an opinion.

 And have has that influenced anybody into going  do you know.

 Um yeah guh qu um I think some of my friends have just I think either way have become a little bit more opinionated because y'know I just kind of just been like kinda getting really angry at them if they don't have an opinion . And so I'd be like y'know you really have to have an opinion on this sorta thing I said oh yeah come to the march with me and if you don't y'know be really strong behind y'know your beliefs 'n' stuff and they're just like oh nah nah well I don't really I'm not really interested.

 Apathetic.

 Yeah 'n' it's just like  y'know it's just it's it's just it's just the western suburbs it's just like y'know I'd much be more interested in my souped-up car y'know.

 Oh okay okay. Uh that's interesting 'cos um I think it was Tim before who was saying that Australians just aren't aware of what's going on around them  that they're very insular they're very into whatever's going on in their uh their own day to day life but not looking outside of that.

 Yeah.

 So um you're obviously not which is um  which is very cool I reckon  . Alright Britney well thanks for your call.

 No worries.

 See you later . 'N' good luck with your friends alright.

 Yep.

 Okay seeya.

 Bye.

 Let's talk to Eddie in Brisbane now g'day Eddie . Thanks for holding on there. Good how are you.

 Yeah not too bad mate.

 What would you like to say tonight.

 Um  I'd  well first like to state that uh I'm an indigenous Australian  and I I just I just find it really interesting how uh  white Australia perceive themselves  as um  believing that this is their country  . Uh I mean obviously I've  I'l I'l I lived here  with with the rest of the white minority  moh majority but I I honestly do believe there's a  um an underlying  current that  no matter what happens if you speak a different language if you look a bit strange if you wear a funny turban if you have funny little dreadlocks or you  look a little bit different uh you will not be accepted in this society. And I'd just like to say to white Australia that uh  you are the visitor. And that black man  this is his country and it always will be. And you should be at least more accepting of other cultures that are wanting to come to this country and some of them I've spent my whole life growing up with Turkish Yugoslavs Asians and there's been good and bad in all of those people . Uh with drug abuse  uh violence 'n' all and all the rest there's been good and bad . And I can't say a particularly any particular race that um that I can pick as being  clean where the white majority seem to think that they're clean. They're clean of their sins or clean of clean of ever doing anything wrong . And they choose to speak out against other people  purely because they're different and I I just say  y'know I'm I'm suppose I'm like the Statue of Liberty singing bring 'em all in mate y'know . 'Cos you're gunna have good and bad it doesn't matter what . And if we're gunna get bombed at there's gunna be a plane that's gunna fly into  uh well a high rise bris Brisbane building it's gunna come and it's gunna happen and whatever what what may be will come . But I don't think it's gunna oo um reflect on whether we take in uh  thirty-five boat refugees from Vietnam. I don't see it hap I don't see that happening as they kind of sitting there saying we're gunna plot 'n' we're gunna send a a fake refugee boat across to kill those  white Australians  y'know  I I just the paranoid Australian  white Australian thinking I just really'd like to like to challenge the people out there listening uh Steve I think his name was Steve before . Interesting guy  like to have a chat with him Britney champion stand up for yourself girl. Power to you . And.

 There's a certain irony isn't there I think you touched on just then that that n y'know given the history of of of white settlement in this country. And now y'know uh turning round and saying well  y'know you can't come in and you can't come in  kinda thing.

 That's right mate they're all from England or Scotland Ireland or Welsh I mean my my grandfather's a Welshman. I mean I my background's Keppel Island my my father's from Torres Strait but I mean I grew up in Inala in one of the poorest toughest suburbs ih in Brisbane which is it's almost like Balmain and and Redfern. It's y'know very tough and it's a very strong Asian content very strong uh  Middle Eastern European content  but I mean th it's good 'n' bad in everyone and  I just really wish wish people would see it I mean that song by The Herd you played when y'know wake up . Just wake up.

 Wake up the country needs a.

 Yeah yeah.

 Shake up .

 Play it three times a day just just do a Triple M on it dude and play it six times  a day .

 Make it make it a high rotation huh.

 Yeah flog it sister .

 We'll see how we go eh . Alright Eddie  thanks very much for your call.

 Thanks for your time Gab.

 Okay see ya.

 Bye.

 One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six uh this is so interesting tonight isn't it let's talk to uh Peter. Now if I just grab him on the uh telephone hello Peter.

 G'day Gaby how you going.

 I'm well how are you.

 Fantastic thanks.

 Now you'd like to comment on uh some of the security issues and that kinda thing.

 Yeah I would first I'd just like to um  um say good on you Eddie thanks for uh  an extremely ed eloquent addition to the um  to the talk tonight and Steven earlier as well 'n' everybody it's it's heartening to realise that there are more than ten or fifteen of us out there that  um are horrified about what's happening to people in real need um  that twenty-five thirty years ago we uh were able to um  assist thousands of refugees from Vietnam yet uh when a hundred-and-fifty or two-hundred people  come over from a demonstratedly evil regime similar to what they were putting up with we have difficulty with. 'N' we put them in a  a dog box in the middle of the desert um . Run by people that are making a profit out of it and um and pat ourselves on the back for saving ourselves from these dreaded terrorists . Um it it uh it's abhorrent um but uh I'm glad everybody's talking about it . That's what we need to do more of us need to talk and act and the rallies today were were very  heartening to see that they were happening . Um  security issues um  I'll give you a brief background of myself I've had um a long history with um the Australian Defence Forces  um particularly um um longer range reconnaissance and um um I have our acquaintances that were with the S A S and still are. Um so I've had a bit of contact with the the the things that most people don't see or hear about . Um I'm not about to tell you that we we still run and hide to the hills but um and and  yeah some of the things that people need to be worried about they aren't and most of the things that they're worried about they shouldn't be. Um I don't seem to recall in anything that I've seen uh about the people that trained to be pilots 'n' took control of airliners in the U S A that they made their way to the U S A in um leaky boats over the  period of nine months . Um they walked through airports. With valid visas. And if anybody from say Jemaah Islamiyah wishes to come to Australia to do that sort of uh harm then that's exactly how they'll do it. They're not going to be coming across with um women and children as a cover. That's just ludicrous and  um typical of some of the um  mindless rhetoric that we've had from this government . Uh.

 'Cos I think the thing those sorta things are tied together in in in a lotta people's minds y'know the whole  the refugee issue  and the security kind of thing.

 Fear of the unknown. Look I'm not I'm not um  uh silly enough to call for a a a a an instant end to mandatory detention. Um  we that we also need to look at what we call mandatory detention. Um in the same way as there are three different ways of being um kept in prison everything from a prison farm where people come and go and look after themselves through to maximum security. We need to have um a varying degree of detention for people coming in. Um naturally there's the issue of disease  both um human and um uh carry uh pathogens that may destroy our our various primary industries that's certainly an issue. Um  we need to say okay um a ten year old child is not likely to be strapping themselves up with five kilograms of plastic explosive so in Woomera where they have access to hundreds of vacant rooms in much better condition uh much better living conditions then put the women and children in those areas. Now if the women and children are there and in being looked after their husbands and partners are not likely to be going to to do too many silly things . And putting people into conditions to and treating them like animals has been proven time and again to be an excellent way to um convert a a normally peaceful person into doing something crazy like sewing their lips together.

 See that's the thing I think a l a uh l that l people y'know you see these images of the lip sewing on on the news and that kinda thing  and and people are think oh well look at the kind of people they are  but but when you are in a pressure situation like  that uh like you said it can make people act in a way that they wouldn't  normally act.

 Now I have a family and um given the same situation I would be doing exactly the same thing. Anything that I could do to draw attention to our plight . Y'know all uh ih if people just take five minutes to shut their eyes and put themselves in that same position. Australia's been attacked with nuclear weapons we need to go to Indonesia for um assistance to escape some terrible tragedy. Now what would happen if we went over there and were treated like that . Y'know where would we be. At any rate we'll get back to the security issues.

 Okay.

 Um. Like I say a lot of people are concerned about things they shouldn't be a lot of people don't have a clue about the things they should be concerned about. Um  I've seen some very interesting things up north. We have a very effective highway running between um down through the highlands um for weapons for marijuana for all kinds of illicit things. I've seen that first hand um I have acquaintances who live in that area and know an awful lot of interesting things um  so y'know and that trade will continue on. There's  very little that can happen with that. Coastwatch has some excellent capabilities uh our over-the-horizon radar uh has some excellent capabilities but um someone who's serious and motivated um will have access to certain technologies certain boats that will not show up with radar um and they'll slip in undetected . Um there has been things found um around the northern areas of Australia that have proved that people have been coming in for an awful long time and um burying things that they might be able to use if they say came over at a later stage . Um now look I'm not advocating that we launch a pre-emptive strike. I know some people might like that and we might fit in well with our friends across the Pacific they might we might get a pat on the back for a pre-emptive strike  but um  my point is that uh the people that we are most concerned about are the ones who really hah we really have the least  defences against . They're the individual who has everything they need to do everything they need to achieve their ends  buried in their mind. They come across they buy a couple of kilograms of fertiliser . Many household products you can buy in bulk quantities and um over the course of a couple of weeks cook up into other things in speed  and um be able to achieve the ends that you wish.

 So  whe people are people are really overly concerned about the wrong sort of issue.

 Most definitely.

 Yeah.

 I mean look at the y'know the apparent the allegedly the world's greatest intelligence services. None of them  either foresaw or took notice of several people that they knew were of of interest  learning how to fly um passenger  jets . Because   for them it was inconceivable um yet it happened . So um look at the bit picture 'n' and and all I can say is that uh those who waver in or believe that most politicians have the best interests in mind is that  any time that you see something in the news or anything that occurs that makes you  um lose control of your emotions or think my God what are these people doing the the children overboard farce  um things like that. Take a step back and think  okay what's that what's really going on take control of your emotions for a few moments and look around to see what else is going on because if nothing else uh John Howard is the master of misdirection . Um  I give him that he's an absolute master at it . And you you look back and and uh politicians in general as well there's a a lot of things going on all over the place um that they would rather they'd there wasn't a lot of scrutiny on and that comes down to trade um  trade agreements things like that.

 He's a very um he's very very good at at at at playing politics I think.

 Mm he's an  excellent politician and I'm  that's not a compliment .

 Alright Peter  we might  leave it there.

 Sorry.

 We might leave it there I think.

 Uh yes sorry I'll.

 No no that's okay no  problem at all.

 Okay then.

 Thanks very much for your  call. And cheers have a good one.

 Have a great night bye-bye.

 You too bye. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six it's coming up to ten o'clock uh Fenella's in after eleven with The Sound Lab give you bit more impo  on that later on we're talking about World Refugee Day today. Love to hear from you if you are  or have been a refugee or if you took part in any of the uh activities today or just if you have an opinion uh whether you agree or don't agree with the government's um legislation and and handling of the situation. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six tonight on The Chatroom with Gaby here on Triple J.



 The Last Days Of April on Triple J. It's On Everything.



 One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six tonight we're talking about World Refugee Day if you can't get through please be patient if you're waiting on the phone please also be patient I will get to you uh as soon as possible. Let's talk to Michael in New South Wales hi Michael.

 Yeah hi Gaby.

 Hi now what would you like to uh say tonight.

 Well um I'm the H R manager at a meat processor in the south western part of New South Wales. And we've had uh at at various times up to about ninety Afghani guys on on uh T P Vs working for us.

 Oh okay temporary prodec protection visas yep.

 Yeah yeah um and so they've um  they've been going through the process of getting their residency . Um but uh I guess from a personal perspective I I um  um my opinions on on refugees 'n' and the process has changed over the last couple of years that I've been working with them. Um for a long time I was of the opinion that that um  uh I guess the rule of law is important in Australia 'n' it  um that's one of the reason it makes us attractive to refugees is that uh that Australia's fairly well run um uh  we're fairly safe in in this country um there's opportunity here if you if you're willing to  hard . Um and  one of the big reasons for that opportunity is is that that we we have some fairly strong laws but I I guess working working with guys coming from some fairly terrible situations um softens your view on it. Um.

 What sorta view do you have now.

 Well   uhs uh I still don't know the I still don't know the answer to the problem. Um  but I I think um. The guys that we've had working for us have come from all sorts of all sorts of professions and walks of life uh we've had guys as that have been schoolteachers you have fellas that have have um driven fruit trucks guys that have been farmers um you name it uh um and we've had them . Um they're they're just ordinary people like you and me they've they've um y'know they've got families behind they're they're trying to uh save money and pay the bills 'n' um  uh one of the earlier callers probably hit the nail on the head anybody that's uh different to us uh is always regarded with some sort of fear and suspicion. Um now now whether it's whether you're Koori 'n' and someone else is white or or you're white and someone's Koori or whether uh particularly if you're an English speaker and someone comes from an Asian or a or an Arabic country where where the differences are much more pronounced. Um people are always gunna be re regarded with suspicion . Um but  but um uh uh I guess you don't have to scratch the skin very deep 'n' and they're they're  they're just ordinary people underneath.

 So thuh so working with these guys from Afghanistan has has really changed your opinion of uh on refugees and your stance on that. What how did the guys settle in. What was  it like for them do you think.

 Well obviously it was very different for them. Um  theh they they have a um  um it's some things they they um had more difficulty with than others . Um we we did a little bit of um  uh I I suppose external external work with them sort of helping them them do uh sort of stepping into the into the Australian society and so on . Uh th they have a fairly strong support group locally it's uh I think it's fairly unofficial rather than than being government funded or anything like that. Um but um the the local guys uh the local or mostly ladies I think um help them with their uh bank accounts 'n' um  uh uh driving licences  things like that yeah  yeah.

 So the  community really got behind them 'n' 'n' 'n' helped them sorta settle settle into the new the new life.

 Yeah yeah it sort of y'know we're a we're a country community and there was a there was a bit of a um a bit of a  uh kerfuffle I suppose um at one stage where there were some um  some fairly strong racist statements being made.

 Okay.

 But um that tended tended to be external agitators. 'N' 'n' what it really did was that it it seemed to make the local people who really couldn't care either way . Um y'know long as these guys kept to themselves and didn't bother them they no-one  r mostly no-one cared. Um people were very concerned that the community would be painted with a um in a in a or painted in a in a very bad light. Um so they tended then to jump off the fence and and be supportive.

 Okay.

 Um and and so certainly the local council is very supportive . Uh and that tends to be the the general community feeling . Um if if people really are concerned at all and and most of them are just just prepared to let them get on with their lives 'n'  um and just li live normally like everybody else does.

 Well that's heartening. Excellent.

 . Yeah so I guess  I dunno. Um  as as far as the the process goes the T P Vs last for three years.

 Mhm.

 Um and at at thirty month  have a letter from the .

 We're losing you Michael.

 .

 Mm uh . We're losing you. Yeah we're losing you sorry Michael we'll uh thank you very much for your call. Uh we might have to leave that there. There's a couple of websites you might wanna have a look at uh of course you can you can just google it or you can use a search engine 'n' 'n' 'n' have a squiz uh I dunno you probably type in Australia or refugee whatever but um there are a couple of website that you might wanna look at. Uh one is of course the uh Department of Immigration Multicultural and inh Indigenous Affairs now that has quite an odd email uh web address rather. It's W W W dot immi dot gov dot A U immi is I double M I dot gov dot A U gov G O V uh there's also the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Now that is dub dub dub dot U N H C R  that's hard to remember till you remember that it stands for United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Dub dub dub dot U N H C R dot C H. Or you can go to the Australian version of that which is uh dub dub dub dot Australia for U N H C R dot org dot A U. I'm gunna put these up on the uh Chatroom website at the end of the show okay so you'll be able to check them out there uh if you wanna have a bit of a look and um y'know might might add something to the debate for you or uh or your opinions in your mind. According to the brochure that I got at the um the rally today there's apparently a hundred-and-sixty-eight children uh currently in detention in Australian detention centres across the country. Uh just a few little facts for you. And um also I while I was at the um the uh well after the rally today I caught up with Ruth Radcliffe who is one of organisers of t of the um Sydney rally and um I'll play you um a little bit of what she said in just a minute.





 That's Ruth Radcliffe who is uh on the organising committee for the Sydney rally of uh World Environment uhf oh I said it again. I keep saying World Environment Day. I don't know why that's lodged in my head. It just is it's strangest thing. Um World Refugee Day of course which is our topic on The Chatroom tonight one-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six let's talk to Brett in Victoria hi Brett.

 How're you going.

 Hey good thanks. What would you like to say tonight.

 Oh basically start off with so everyone knows where I'm coming from I disagree with the way that the uh government is dealing with the situation at this point in time. I do agree with the security issues to some point but uh as one uh of your previous people said that they uh the security issue isn't as great as uh people make it out to be. But uh just to highlight just one aspect that I'm aware of that uh realistically these p places where these people are staying although they are being held um in detention so to speak they were military bases at one stage which were fine for our y'know our defence forces that used to go and fight 'n' save our lives 'n' all that sorta thing. And they had to spend billions of dollars to upgrade them so that they were acceptable for refugees. I think that that's uh something that's sorta lost on a lotta people that y'know turn around 'n' say that they haven't got any good conditions and that they are in appalling conditions well if they're in appalling conditions they should really be uh backing up the uh defence force 'n' trying to get uh something happening to the defence force.

 Yeah there's a an interesting point. Because uh yeah. No I s I um I'm just thinking h how I wonder how much of that is  uh okay so the government did the upgrade. Okay  yeah I I was just.

 The government's done the upgrade basically they were  active bases at one stage . Um then they were taken offline and uh one of 'em was a case of right we're closing down this base and we're turning it into a refugee camp and uh that was basically it they spent  uh heaps of money trying to upgrade it. Uh obviously some of it had to be to cater to families  and children and I definitely disagree with the fact that they're hel holding children. But um yeah they had to spend lots of money to uh upgrade . So that these people y'know so. And people yet still complain how bad conditions are there and  I mean  agreeably uh regrettably so these people uh if put into a position where they feel that they need to highlight situation so they do dramatic things 'n' they basically deteriorate their own conditions by doing that. So they've the damage that they cause basically affects them and other people living in the uh detention centres.

 Mm I mean it's interesting how a phrase like appalling conditions can also be interpreted in in a lotta different ways. Y'know like uh someone may say the conditions were appalling because they're thinking okay these people are locked up and that that's that's y'know that's why they say that but theh they may not even be talking about the building and then someone else will say oh okay obviously it's a complete slum and then y'know there it's like kinda like one of those Chinese whispers things almost 'n'.

 Well it it uh well  many many years many years ago they actually turn round 'n' when this actually started hap when they were putting 'em into the detention centres 'n' stuff like that they were saying that the facilities aren't up to scratch and  I mean seriously they've been given a whole heap more facilities th th that our defence forces don't have or have to pay extra to get and that the government's just gone yep no worries. Here it all is and uh people are saying nup the facilities aren't up to scratch . So I mean  look. Having said that though I disagree with uh what's happening with them I think that I don't have a complete answer but y'know even maybe a immigration community zone like a y'know like a shire council type area sizewise where they have um y'know people sort of living and working not actually b behind bars and behind a caged fence  so to speak but just something a little bit more family friendly  um so that those 'cos I do believe that the security checks need to be done um. I believe that ninety-five percent of people that are coming through are legitimate but then I have heard of situations where ex uh Iraqi republican guard have been y'know sent back to Iraq  y'know from I think it was Woomera I I think I heard that one from but uh y'know these security checks do need to be taking place but I think two years is far too long to do them so.

 I don't understand why it takes that long to be honest. That's always been a sticking point with me I'm thinking well y'know why  how can it take that long to suss out where someone's from.

 Oh it's well it's the fact that they give uh false information but uh the  in in England they they do it in less than six months.

 Yeah.

 So I mean if England can do it in less than six months and we're supposed to be  under the umbrella of the uh British so to speak with the uh queen and such shouldn't we be running that way instead of doing the old uh head up Bush's arse thing and y'know doing it their way so.

 Doing it yeah for s taking so long and all that . Yeah I dunno it's it's it's w it's one for debate definitely I'd be interested if um if anyone like to comment on what you've said.

 Well just before I've just I've just to cut 'n' get fifteen more minutes of fame so to speak   but uh  the the the tamp the Tampa um situation um when they put them on H M A S Manoora and moved them to uh one of the islands. Um can't remember which one but uh I know for a fact that uh the uh ship's company afterwards I know a few of 'em weren't too happy with the way things went down on the ship but uh having to clean up faeces off walls 'n' um off the roofs of the ships 'n' all that sorta stuff 'n' the amount of damage that they did on the ship on that um short ride. I mean admittedly it was more than a week from the Tampa to the actual island but uh yeah the amount of  trauma they caused the crew  that y'know ill-prepared for what was actually going on weren't didn't uh receive any training for . And I think that's also a problem with our immigration uh ih not the  yeah the detention centre um security guards they're not they're more security guards than uh than detention centre  y'know watchers. They they haven't received the proper training so  I think that goes.

 This is not. They're unusual situations. Y'know the we're not talking about y'know your regular security situations we're talking about y'know luh like we were saying before people who have come from sih yih situations of of extreme pressure and and y'know after being on wuh you mentioned the Tampa. After being on the Tampa for so long I can only imagine that that it musta been you know pretty difficult to be loaded onto the Manoora and and and shipped off again. I I dunno but um but like you said. If the guards aren't having special training to deal with situations like this then that that can be a problem.

  these people are coming from uh areas where like at thirteen they become a man 'n' they go through ritual  some sorta ritual and they receive scarring from that sort of  ritual I mean there it's completely different culture than to what we understand  'n' y'know it's  something's something's gotta be better done for it that's for sure 'n' I I I do not believe anything that Howard says. And uh do not believe a lotta what politicians say and the way they go about things I think that uh yeah. I think that more people need to sort of step up 'n' say look now we gotta do something better about it we gotta  sorta try 'n' think of something better for it too. So it doesn't it doesn't affect as many people  as what it is. That's right but I mean  I I just wanted to sorta highlight the fact that y'know a lotta people are making a big song and dance about certain things but y'know if they're gunna make a  a song and dance about uh the conditions the the facilities that they live in y'know they should be uh taking uh taking up arms about uh the way our defence force is treated then  because I mean the defence force don't get a  haven't received the facilities that uh y'know these guys received when they first when it first happened I don't know what it's like these days . Considering how many people been through 'n'  y'know what sort of what they've done to it 'n' stuff like that but uh yeah  just the amount of facility upgrade 'n' the the amount of money they spent putting that putting that up so yeah.

 Alright then well  you've you've raised some very interesting points um definitely Brett 'n' thanks for your call.

 No worries Gaby catch ya later.

 Okay. Yihs you too see ya bye.

 Bye.

 One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six tonight if you'd like to uh comment or offer your own opinion World Refugee Day is today that's our topic tonight in the chat.



 We just heard Home Is Where The Heart Is from John Butler Trio it's a song about refugees so it's appropriate for tonight we're talking about World Refugee Day. Now so many calls apologies if you're trying to get through and you can't or if you're hanging on the phone be patient uh promise we won't be too long. Uh let's talk to Leah on the Gold Coast hi Leah.

 Hi Gaby.

 What would you like to say.

 Um I'd just like to put forward the idea that um Amanda Vanstone is the new um immigration officer. Is that that's right isn't it.

 She's the minister for immigration yeah.

 Yeah. Okay um she seems like a reasonable and quite intelligent lady um quite responsible and um I'm hoping that she's receiving some ideas and putting forward the ideas to um maybe make a better lifestyle for the mandatory detention the uh the refugees in them. Because I mean I don't seem to hear any sort of counteract arguments from the government saying that they are in fact doing cultural um initiatives within the mandatory detention. I don't see any artwork from the mandatory detention. I mean there's no discussion about self-sufficiency of the mandatory detention there's a lotta discussion about um underfunding I mean I'm sure that a lot of activities that could go on in the detention centre are probably overwhelmed with pathetic workplace health and safety requirements like they can't have a shovel in case they do something. I mean I'm just I'm just confused that the government hasn't come forward and said hey look y'know you might be thinking this way that the media's portrayed the detention centres but actually we're doing a whole heap of really good things. I mean this argument's been going on for like eighteen months or something and it's just like whoa.

 They have been kinda silent on the issue really haven't they . I mean every so often they come out and go uh well y'know bluh bluh blu bluh blah but there's never anything mm like I think you said on the phone there's never anything proactive about it.

 Yeah  I meh I mean I'm really concerned about their P R work because I mean if they were a a private organisation that the last thing they would wanna be doing is taking a back burner on such a big issue. I mean the g the the financial situation of Australia we're in a surplus I'm sure we can afford three-million dollars to bloody pay for some paint and get some volunteers to go in and coordinate projects for them. Y'know I just don't hih sih hear any sorta community involvement or the government saying look we've got this new um initiative why don't some volunteers step forward I mean how many people were at the march today over two thousand.

 Mm.

 I mean I'm sure that within that two-thousand people there's probably a hundred qualified people that could go and volunteer.

 Perhaps the government are silent 'cos there isn't that much going on. I dunno.

 Yih yeah and that's why I'm I'm trying to say that I'm sure that Amanda Vanstone would be listening to this because she is a professional and she's in the government and she's intelligent so I'm hoping that she's gunna take on board what's been said tonight and do something about it. And I mean I'm uh also I I I do agree in mandatory detention. Um I think that to let um a refugee straight out into the community would be incredibly distressing to their psychological makeup and I'm also a mother so it distresses me that people would wanna take children away from the families. I mean I'm I know that uh the situation might not be the best but if you're a four year old child who says who's been told that hey it's a better situation in this little sponsor family over here you just wouldn't be able to comprehend it so I mean it's a little bit naive just to say children shouldn't be in the mandatory detention it would just.

 That's interesting I wonder what the um  no I hadn't really thought of it like that before yeah that separating kids from their families I wonder if people pushing for the release of the children have any kinda plan around that or maybe they've they're sort of mm  pushing for some kind of something different that I I'm just not I don't know about 'n'  d'love to hear from someone if uh if that's their take on it definitely.

 I mean that's why I'm kinda thinking that if they were thinking of self-sufficiency I mean having their own garden and having. I'm sure there's like um carpenters within the mandatory detention who can show the kids how to build things and to show them that hey we're in this place but the adults can get by and you can get by and let's all have a good time I mean uh I'd love to see some instruments go in there 'n' like so at night time the kids can learn and watch the people around them enjoying things I mean there's no joy there's just a lotta sorrow it just seems.

 Mm. I think there's a uh I can't speak for all the detention centres but I  know for a fact at least at Villawood there's there's now like a kids' playroom 'n' 'n' that sorta thing. 'Cos I was a little bit involved with that but um  but I think a lotta the the stuff the uh that that goes in does come from from volunteers . But then I suppose there are strict requirements 'n' 'n' rules around what you can actually take in 'n' y'know uh uh you'd have to think about things that can actually cause harm or 'cos I mean there's there'd be  y you huh I guess you'd have to think about y'know y m uh like you said with the shovel . Something like that could be  used y'know to to harm to self  harm that kinda thing.

 So I mean if the government was to come forward and say hey everybody you're all got  some good ideas. This is this is a guideline  then bring it on in. I dunno. Just good B  R  they're not doing good P R .

  I'd have to agree .

 You're doing a good job Gaby and  good luck to Australia there's hope for us all .

 Cheers Leah you have a good night alright.

 Okay bye.

 Bye. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six tonight we'll talk to Grant in Whyalla now hello Grant.

 G'day how you going Gaby.

 Hm I'm well how are you.

 I'm uh I'm well and I'm  I've been s tearing this issue over in my mind trying to think well look is there any way that we can be equitable to all parties here and for everyone to just find the process not a problem. And there isn't. And and the and here's sort of m I perceive why and I perhaps mightn't be so popular for this but but uh here we here we go. The whole reason that that refugees would find Australia attractive is because Australia is quite a well to do organised well managed place. We have despite the fact we moan about it incessantly and as people and we do our government's actually pretty good by world standards and and the facilities we've provided here are very good and we're fairly affluent and there's lots of free space. There's good reasons to be in Australia. But they exist because they're policed. And that's  underpins it all. If if Australia wasn't a well-managed well-policed place it wouldn't be desirable for refugees. And so I think that those in detention while it is a very stressful time and I I couldn't begin to imagine what they go through on an individual basis need to take a bit of heart in that well it's reassuring that we're here because it shows these people don't just let anybody in and that we actually have a mechanism that we have to go through to ensure that those that come to live 'n' and stay in Australia deserve to be here and and I think that's that's very important. Um two years is is an excessively long time but let's look at the issues they contend with it isn't just people infiltrating Australian security and posing a risk to the nation. As someone said before it's disease. How long do symptoms take. What disease are we talking about they're uh they're all they're they're th it's a it's a big conundrum. Um it it needs to be this way it probably doesn't need to be that that that uh immigrants are jailed. I do disagree with the conditions. I think  the farm idea would be much better. But perhaps that's where the process needs to be refined. The actual mandatory detention is not the enemy here . Ih it's it's actually an instrument of justice. And it needs to be considered such. Otherwise its purs purpose is lost. Um we need to we need to be equitable to the people who have already gone through the proper channels and have taken up residency in Australia people who were born here people who have been refugees and have had status granted uh too. Ih it's it's not wise to open the sluice gates and just let people in willy nilly. That's that's not a good approach there's no way to know as well that those people y'know there's no way to document them in that sense no way to see that when they become Australian citizens that they're really making use of the facilities they provide no no way to know that they're actually uh getting on and prospering no way to access no way to access programs that are put in to help people who are integrating into a society. All of those ih ih it's just a it's a part of the process that's a bit of a necessary evil. And it needs to be considered such. Um as well though uh one one of one caller who I really liked earlier because he he ps he was a thinker um sort of said that some of the issues we need to be concerned about we're not 'n' some of issues we're concerned about we shouldn't be  um I I support that position too to a to an extent. Um he was saying though how it was ludicrous to consider that that uh that people who posed a threat to uh security of the nation would would come in in leaky boats well I would've thought it was ludicrous to strap C four to one's body and walk into a public place in the name of uh appeasing Allah but but sometimes from the countries that these people come from that's done and that's fairly extreme and he also said that uh the intelligence services of the world y'know didn't cuh thought it too impossible to consider that someone would steal a plane and crash it. I think what we're seeing here is it's it's not for us to be a barometer of oh well this could happen it's to prepare for all possible circumstances. Um because people who are crazy enough to strap explosives to their body 'n' and go and kill illis innocent people will certainly sit nine months out on a leaky boat. And and that's a problem . So ih ih well what do you do when when uh when you're trying to filter out people who are so committed to their cause that they're prepared to go to such lengths. It's it makes it very difficult. Um I don't think it's right that we that we uh are unnecessarily suspicious of people I don't think it should be that way at all . And we shouldn't lock people up I I totally agree with that but there needs to still be a clear-cut mechanism of assessing a person's status so as we can maintain the Australia that we live in and and I sort of see that while the detention centres themselves perhaps need a reworking the process otherwise is is fairly right. And uh I sort of praise our government because they've had a difficult chore of maintaining all our domestic issues and and sort of bringing this to to some form of human human acceptability which they've they've done these people are fed they are clothed they are watered they've received medical attention. They come from terrible places where they've been shot at and hung and I would be happy to be fed and sit and wait for my status to be assessed in a safe country coming away from those things. And and I know that ih ih probably not all people would respond that way but some people y'know when you incarcerate them um that you do institutionalise people y'know and that does that does psychologically change the way they are and so I think that that the detention centres themselves need to be more user-friendly if you like . But but by the same token um ih these people are already doing so much better than they have been. Uh  are we being a little bit unfair to to our own people um by by insisting that mandary  detention is just a ridiculous idea and it should be done away with. Um the one of the things I also luh y'know think that it's it necessary to be careful of here is we've I heard it said tonight that Mr Howard whether you support the Liberal government's standing or not um is is a great politician and that's not necessarily good thing but people who also are a little bit evangelistic about about the rights and liberties being abused of of refugees are equally masters of spin okay and.

 It comes from both sides.

 Yeah exactly it's  it's thunderstorm in a teacup stuff to an extent y'know and um  y'know I'd I just sort of would would urge listeners not to side either way but to really consider what is involved y'know if you had come from a war torn battered country would you be happy to be fed 'n' wait out X time even a couple of years if it meant that afterwards you would be a free person free from persecution and able to start a new life over again in in a m in a hospitable nation that that makes it possible to do so. Um I've never heard the Liberal government accuse these people of being criminals um that was ventured a little while ago. I've never ever heard that. Um I think it would be political suicide for them to do it they're smarter than that so uh w we need to just.

 People might argue that they they perhaps treat them in that manner though I think that's  where that.

 Th the way  they get tr treated with with being incarcerated is a problem right that that is the Achilles heel of the process . It really is. That is the problem from what I perceive right that is where people need to focus on it. Um we need to give our government feedback the kind of detention that we use isn't isn't appropriate okay. But the the overall mechanism is is very much a good thing and and wouldn't serve these people well if it didn't exist . As much as as much as the rest of the nation. Um the the their diets are catered for any unique y'know religious um opinions that they may have any any beliefs that regard food that's all catered for um. That's that's good stuff y'know uh ih it's pretty much embracing allowing them to be uh their own people and because Australia is a multicultural nation. Um and so much of Australian society is already quite uh different from the Anglo-Saxon society it was about two-hundred years ago when we moved here  y'know it it's already changed so much that it does cater well for those people anyway  y'know because of it. Um I I can I'm probably going to be flamed but  . But I I'm I'm quite happy with it I think that there's room for improvement and there always is but at the end of day um it's it's the way it needs to be  to truly service everybody equitably and um you yeah it's  it's sticky it's a sticky mess.  I don't envy the  the politicians whose job it is to actually sort this out and make it policy because ih  it's it's not easy.

 It is devuh difficult definitely. Be interesting to see um if if uh people have any response to what you've said 'cos you've raised some very interesting points there.

 One other thing just to leave you with  I heard that I forget the lady's name but you played a recording that you'd spoken with uh y'know a little earlier just before.

 Ah yes Ruth.

 Yeah yep. One of the things she said is that we led to wuh y'know believe that these people've well these people're led to believe they've done something wrong. No. They are entitled to approach Australia approach for refugee status. Right. That does not mean they're entitled to walk in and that lady sort of the way she phrased it was very clever and she made it appear that that's the case. That is not  okay. So their rights have been upheld. They have been put in mandatory detention while their application is assessed our United Nations contractual obligation has been met. And and Australia's very good at meeting its contractual obligations to the U N I might add.

 Mhm.

 Thank you very much Gaby.

 No problem Grant . Thank you for calling.

 See you later.

 See ya bye. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six give us a call let's talk to Laurence who's been waiting patiently in Canberra hello Laurence.

 Hi.

 Hi what would you like to say tonight.

 Um I think it's like um just really strange how  like I think it's forty-three percent of Australia is from origins of different countries.

 Mhm.

 And then when these people come we just refuse them  and why can't like who are these um like tention  camps run by. Like shouldn't they be run by like the Red Cross or Salvation Army.

 Oh okay um.

 Instead of people with guns.

 Yeah I think they're they're privately they're privately run in conjunction with the government as far as I'm aware. Um so you you you'd say that they should be run by humanitarian groups or something.

 Yeah.

 Okay why's that.

 Um its just because they have a call to fulfil and they wanna fulfil that um they should be able to help these people and  I think it's just that  um humanitarian these people have been trained in dealing with people of this origin of people coming from different countries different countries and different beliefs so they've been training this so it would just be a wise decision to put them in charge of these um detention centres.

 Oh okay. That's interesting 'cos it mm someone was saying I can't remember who now  someone was saying before how the um the guards aren't trained for  for for this kinda thing and you're saying that y'know mm humanitarian groups are better would be better able to to deal with this uh with uh with refugees because they're they're trained in that area.

 Yeah and  another thing is like I'm a teenager so basically I'm just a media junkie. I watch a lot of T V and it's just just really strange how much this is just like put below deck like . On news 'n' everything it's always like the last story or something. And you got like main headline stories on like Channel Ten about um like art galleries 'n' overseas but then you got like lih you got like really big issues like proper issues and they've put last for a segment of about one minute.

 Oh okay.

 So I think it's.

 The priorities are wrong.

 We need to just um  kind of like really show Australia what's going on and I stand for neither side because  um  I don't know like the real facts of it so I can't really make up my decision . And I think most Australia's in that state at the moment they don't know what's really happening there. So to make a proper decision we need to know what's really happening in the detention centres.

 So there's a lack of information.

 Yeah a big lack of information.

 If you had the information would you have you have strong feeling about it.

 Um if I had the information  um well I'd probuh I'm right now I'm not against it but I think um the conditions could be better . And like the guy said um one of the callers before he said that um they there's why don't we like build a shire or something and there's heaps of empty like campsites 'cos I used to be in scouts . And we went to camps and all that . And  there's like cabins and it's in like forests 'n' all that why can't they go there inst  instead of like a prison like building.

 Yeah yeah oh a couple of couple of people have mentioned something like that tonight too I think yeah it's an interesting idea definitely. Um 'n' you'd like to see that would you yeah.

 Yeah.

 Oh okay then. Alright Laurence well thanks for your call that's .

 Oh thanks for your time Gaby.

 Good to hear from you see you later.

 Goodbye.

 Bye. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six. Britney was saying before too that her um her friends are apathetic and uh Laurence was just saying y'know if he had the information he could um perhaps make up his mind a little a little clearer. A few people have actually mentioned a lack of information tonight. Mm interesting alright let's move on uh talk to Ted in Traralgon who's been very patient hello Ted.

 Yeah I thought I'd rung Centrelink for a while.

  uh uh  I think the old on hold music is better  I hope .

 Oh definitely.

 What would you like to say tonight Ted.

 Um just a f few early comments your earlier callers have made  um with the letting the children go I'd thought of that does that mean they're separating from their parents . 'Cos we've just had a really major problem with the stolen generation are we gunna have a big problem in the future with the  borrowed generation.

 Yeah I dunno um I to be honest I dunno much about that. I'd love to hear from someone who who's  across that .

 I can't see how that how that can work um.

 Yeah I think it would be a separation  as far as I know.

 Uh wh when I I've also thought that with the government excising the um oh at Christmas Island that's an immigration zone  and the islands does that mean those people aren't entitled to commonwealth benefits that live on those islands now. 'Cos they've decided they're not part of Australia.

 Uh gawd . No idea  you'll well you will have to ring Centrelink for that one .

 Oh God God no not that please not that.

 No.

 Um but yeah  oh with the Tampa crisis when that came up they they were calling the people queuejumpers.

 Yeah.

 Um there's no queues in Iraq or Afghanistan.

 Ah okay.

 That's what sort of uh concerned me then I thought how can you jump a queue when there isn't one there.

 Mhm.

 That  sort of got to me a bit anyway.

 Okay.

 But and one of the other caller mentioned um he was an indigenous Australian . Yeah um so am I my skin's white though but I was born in Australia. That makes me just as indigesn indigenous as him.

 Ah we have the the the indigenous quibble.

 Yeah but that's  just me anyway.

 The no the the the.

 But ih ih it's my country too.

 Mm. Okay yeah no  I un totally understand that yeah.

 Yeah but I was thinking maybe if all the callers y'know wrote to their local politicians we might get something start to get something done instead of just ringing a radio station.

 Mm.

 And all write to Mrs Vanstone.

 Yeah if everybody sort of um y'know put their put their thoughts onto paper.

 Yeah apathy seems to be a growing sport.

 Never underveh underestimate the power of the word I reckon.

 True but you've gotta send it to them.

 Yeah absolutely . Definitely . Alright Ted.

 But anyway.

 Ih anything else or.

 Uh yeah I was just thinking of people they get here they the I've scribbled a few notes down on a bit of paper um they come from a p an oppressive country like Iraq or Afghanistan . They get here we lock 'em in a prison they must maybe go wake up and think same shit different place.

 Yeah .

 Anyway.

 Yeah no I uh uh ss.

 But yeah we all need to get off our butts 'n' get in touch with politicians 'n'. Like  if a politician if Amanda Vanstone gets two-thousand letters from the people that were at the protest she might think mm pyuh better do something here.

  better pay a little bit of attention.

 Yeah so.

 Mm mm alright Ted wuh.

 It's the only way it'll change.

 Thank thank you for your call and thanks for being so patient.

 Yeah no worries.

 Okay . Talk to you again bye. One-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six interesting what Ted was just saying about queues. I thought I'd just play you uh a little bit of um I'd I'd spoke to um to this woman Ruth uh Ruth Radcliffe uh who's who's one of the organisers of World Refugee Day today and I've been playing a little bit throughout the show of what she said. I wasn't gunna play any more because I thought we had we'd heard enough but uh but just what Ted was saying about queuejumpers I thought it might be interesting to uh hear what she had to say about that.



 I thought that was far too topical not to play tonight the band is called The Invisible Hand 'n' that's called Go Home Refugees just a little tune that I turned up in the Triple J music library tonight before the show started.



 World Refugees Day . Those uh those uh web addresses again Department of Immigration is dub dub dub dot I double M I dot gov dot A U or you can check out um the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at dub dub dub dot U N H C R dot C H. There's an Australian version of that too you can google it. I'll put those addresses up at the end just a couple of things you might wanna look at to uh further the debate we're almost outta time Fenella Kernebone's coming up real soon in the Sound Lab heaps and heaps of new music this week Wagon Christ um uh the Helsinki Duo as well the sound of a baby grand piano on fire. I'm intrigued. also a taste of Fenella's interview with Mum  a wonderful Icelandic outfit that's coming up in about ten minutes time. Let's see if we can race through a few final calls though before we get outta here uh let me see who we have Britney another Britney not the Britney we spoke to before but Britney from Brisbane hello.

 Hi.

 Hi what would you like to say tonight.

 Um ultimately what I'm all about and what I wanna argue is that mandatory detention is against international covenants on human rights that Australia has signed and agreed to expound principally in society. One of the previous callers argued that these p um people's rights have been upheld and they have not um Australia has not upheld its contractual oblication  to the United Nations. Um article nine of the international declaration of human rights actually says that no-one shall be subjected to arbitrary arrest detention or exile . Um ultimately the migration act section one-hundred-and-seventy-eight um does not uphold this contractual obligation. Um ultimately it says that these sorta people will be um kept in immigration detention. Um so basically what I'm here tonight to say is that um this law this section in particular needs to be looked at because um this is against human rights um we're not upholding the rule of law we're not giving these people a fair chance. Um mandatory detention has doesn't have to take as long as it does here in Australia.

 Yeah because I think it takes a lot longer here than than most other places in the world.

 It does. Um and someone said before also that um m um that it takes longer because uh they give false information. Often it's because the countries that they come from will not um participate and help with the actual um gaining of status by  providing Australia with information and that's also um adds to the time that it takes for them to be processed.

 Okay so  that that just makes it uh a longer process.

 Yeah exactly and  like  I really think and I really disagree that these people shouldn't be shouldn't have to be held in these sort of places for years on end when they have no real idea where they're going what's happening. They're sometimes they're denied legal access they're um y'know two phones for two-hundred people in immigration duh um centres it's just not fair it's just not it's just not right.

 Mhm mhm you're obviously very passionate about it.

 Oh definitely  um I think that if nothing's done here human rights will continue to be violated lives will be at stake and the integrity of the Australian signature on international covenants will continually will continue to be questioned all because it's supposedly in the best interest of Australia.

 What would you like to see happen Britney.

 Um I'm not really sure what suggestions I can put forward. I know I don't have all the answers but there has to be another way . I'm not suggesting that security checks should not be done and that we should let these people in willy nilly as someone said before but um I really do think that there's other ways  and in particular like a few people have suggested y'know sending them to farms or y'know home stay there are other ways and these are options that our government needs to explore look at ok  um options that overseas other western countries have taken. Um compared to other places we har we get hardly any refu um asylum seekers  come to our shores . And so I think that where it's a bigger problem and these people have dealt with it without having to enforce mandatory detention so I really think that looking at overseas policies would be an idea.

 Mm with less space too I might add.

 Oh exactly.

 It's interesting isn't it. Alright then uh Britney thanks very much for your call.

 No worries thanks very much.

 Okay bye . Let's talk to Jesse in Brisbane hi Jesse.

 How are you Gaby.

 Good thank you yourself.

 Oh yeah not too bad.

 What would you like to say.

 Um I'm just I think that uh people are are looking at uh a picture made up of a single ingredient there're a lot of uh different variables that go into um this equation more more so a uh a moral standing point that people would like to argue but the fact of the matter is that it's not a moral argument and this what I am about to say  will probably tread on a lot of toes but it actually goes out to Grant because he's a very smart man and he said what a lot of people should be thinking but are very afraid to say obviously. It's not a um it's not a legal standing point that people would like to argue they say that um the the human rights of refugees are being violated but that's a that's a moral standing point that they're looking at. That's human rights as a person what would you do to another person do unto others as you would have them do to you but  they have entered the country illegally. It is no longer a moral argument it is a legal argument. People have to do what is right by the laws of the government that they fall under. We're only following Australian il following Australian laws fair enough that the U N has sanctioned that we must uphold human rights. But is that if is that only if the person has entered the country legally. I mean do they have a legal standing point if they enter the country the way they do . I think that that um that issue needs to be addressed more and um people need to stop focusing on what they're told by the meedh with like  people don't identify um variable mediums either th you need to um  you need to put the networks into their own class you've got Channel Seven you've got A B C you've got Channel Ten and then then you've got Channel Nine. Now Channel Nine is the Liberal government as everybody knows. But the a see trust the A B C to uh to bring up a controversial argument like this and let people actually say what they want to say . It's um it's very good I think I think it needed to be done. But um it's it's just a lot of um as as a um an earlier listener said before it's just a lot of media outsourcing. People hear something on the news 'n' they hear something completely different on another n on a uh another news update or or in the papers or anything and they'll believe it . It's it's gotten to a point where information is that outsourced and that widely outsourced now that people don't know what to believe. You need to get back to the basics in life and find the facts out for yourself before you start making up your own mind. You need to decide what's relevant to you and relevant to your own circumstances and then make up your own opinion. When uh when I say that though it's um it's hard to find and hard to come by the uh the relevant facts when you've got so much outsourcing but the uh that gentleman from um from the A C T said that our our country is made up by multicultural diversity but you look at possibly look at the generations that these foreigners have come into Australia which probably would have been about the same time as the baby boomers. See these people have come in just after the war when multiculturalism was an oh I dunno wuh I suppose was an acceptable entity. You've got all these people and theh the fact of the matter was that they were only allowed into the country w if they had a trade.

 Mm.

 So we've only let people in that who were who were foreigners that are of any use to us anyway. So it's not as if they got a free ride back then or anything like that. They were let into the country because they were of some use to us it's not as if they were let in willy nilly back in the day. The only reason why they came in is because they had a trade . So if ih I'm not saying that um that foreigners who have a trade should should only be allowed in but I think that um a as it's said ih two years is a is a very painful length of time to be screened  for your um for your legal purposes but there there are a lot of variables that come into it like health and and um and toh possible um the possibility of of being a terrorist suspect. Things like that there's a lot of um a lot of arguments that come into it that people need to look at before they start saying that um that John Howard's doing this or that Mark Latham isn't doing that . It's um it's not ih it's not that case at all.

 Yeah alright we're almost out of time Jesse um but thanks very much for your call.

 No worries.

 We won't have time for a response to your call but um but thank you very much.

 No worries.

 Okay see ya.

 Thanks for that.

 Uh let's see if we can just squeeze in one more person uh Kieran in Ballarat just just pick one thing and uh and 'cos you're the last caller.

 Um okay yeah thanks for that Gaby.

 That's alright.

 Um and now that last caller I was just gunna say the thing about what you say uh I don't think you should really look at people as if n n they're tools that can be used for you but anyway I think it comes down to that like in this country we have uh like we're just lucky to be born here basically we're lucky to be and it's just by chance that you end up here Australia isn't uh Australia needs to like ignore their like uh commercial news outlets that don't show you what happens in the rest of the world but you need to look out and you need to like maybe meet some of the people who've been in these situations. And we can't comprehend what kind of hell they've been through. And then we bring 'em here 'n' we put 'em in jail. 'N' make it worse. And so I think it just comes down to looking at yourself and going well am I glad that I'm in this country do I know how good it .

 And speaking of welcomes and people we love Ramona Koval welcome back.

 Thank you Sandy it's lovely to be back with you and y you're right it's a great warm hearted book full of luck and fate and  fish and gambling  'n' Anzacs and if you'd like to have your say in the program you can join  our um online discussion at A B C dot net dot A U slash R N and follow the links to Australia Talks Books or phone us I'd like you to phone us I wanna talk to you it's been a while  on one-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one  one-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one  and also joining us for the second time Australia Talks Books Tim Winton from Perth Tim welcome.

 Thanks  nice nice to be here.

 Yeah nice to have you  back again.

 Wherever I am.

  Yes disembodied voice out there in the universe. Nice to have you back with us Tim.

 Ah thanks Sandy.

 Well let's start with a reading an and um I'm I'm gunna r I'm gunna be the one who reads this bit and it's gunna be such a pleasure  because just  just have a listen to how this beautiful big book starts.



 What a knockout beginning that is.

 Isn't it amazing.

 And and Tim I I reread your book this week but before I did I tried to remember  what I could about reading Cloudstreet the first time. And what I recalled was the house that breathed in and out as if it were alive  and about the warmth of the families who shared it and about the celebration of a very Australian way of life  and I bet I'm not alone in that  and I wondered is that what you thought you were gunna do as you y'know got into Cloudstreet got into the house began to write it.

 Well s first thank you but um no I didn't know what I was doing  I was honestly just finding my way day to day uh over the years that I was that I was working on it and um I suppose in retrospect um enjoying myself enough not to worry.  I I didn't yeah I didn't have a plan.

 Tim what's it like revisiting a novel that you wrote over a decade ago.

 Well it's a little uh bizarre I mean I haven't reread it um  un unlike you two I haven't done my homework  so uh I'm sure I'm gunna be caught out in in in in uh ih in any question uh.

 There will be a test you know .

 I won't pass the verb the the oral I just know it. Um but it's it's very odd um it's really I guess the only equivalent wuh would be be y'know an old photo album of y'know how you looked at school 'n' your daggy haircut 'n' the girlfriend who y'know only spoke to you for nine minutes of your entire life y'know it's a  it's such a long time ago. I mean I wrote this book in the nineteen-eighties. And I had a I had a y'know a toddler uh who's now  twenty years old  so it's it's y'know and and he has brothers and sisters so  so it's a y'know it's a very long time ago and it's it's almost as though  it was written by somebody else but I have to say y'know hearing Ramona uh r read it uh I there was a flicker of recognition  .

 It's got your name on the cover though  so it must be yours. Tim tell me about the creation of the house at Cloud Street it's a kind of house that we're instantly comfortable in it's big and rambling and all kinds of possibilities are there I think you said  it's a big sagging joint. Ih is it totally a house of your imagination was there ever a house like that for you.

 No the the uh there was there was never a place um and y'know the the more I say it the the the less effect that seems to have I think people y'know seem to uh trawl about um trying to locate the exact uh house and I've had lots of mail to that effect over the years. Um someone actually gave up and just named a block of flats Cloudstreet in a in a in the neighbourhood uh just to just to stump everybody I think. Um no I I just h had I mean once I realised I had these two families on the go and um  I I I just thought about about how wuh h y'know would be interesting to put them together and I I needed a house so I had to make up a house. Uh and it was that's all it was I mean. The neighbourhoods are yeah the neighbourhoods that my grandparents and my parents um grew up in um between the wars and after the war. And uh that was that was all I was going on really a kind of a  a milieu and and some family mythology.

 Yes es it made me start thinking about all of the great  houses that have touched me in literature and a a couple in particular I think are Georges Perec's Life a User's Manual and  and my favourite the wonderful bizarre architecture of the house in Crowley's book Little Big. Uh are there others that come to your mind Ramona when you think about houses in books.

 Look of course Jane Eyre  you know that sort of gothic scary house with the  with the first wife um in the in the uh the top what's it called the top the um attic the attic   and uh My Mother's House a a a book by Colette that I I really loved when I was a kid. I mean it certainly Tim gives you a big theatre to work in doesn't it it's sort of like having a lot of different stage sets.

 Yeah and I and I needed a big one 'cos there was a few of them. Um and and and and th later in the process I realised there was more to come in terms of um  y'know strangers and blow throughs and and whatever it's it's um.

 And you had to have a shop at the front too.

 Yes.

 Yeah well  I had to have a shop at the front partly because the y'know the m so much family mythology revolved around my  my uh father's parents um suburban shop and um. 

 Wuh what did it sell.

 Oh they just had a t y'know everything really. Um but it was m yeah mostly a sort of small goods kind of uh neighbourhood shop um .

 Homemade ice-cream.

 Yes yeah hih my my uh grandfather was a was a pretty accomplished um cook pastry cook and uh he he did a he did a mean ice-cream and uh yeah they were a kind of uh very sort of notable couple um in the in the y'know in the in the neighbourhood b uh between the first world war and and Vietnam I suppose so uh. And ih interesting talking about houses I mean when I was writing this book  I began it in a in Australia and then I I I left for the first time and  lived in in Paris and in uh in Ireland and in Greece and particularly when I was in Ireland I really did literally understand that houses had their own personalities and and their own lives and  yeah they just had to be standing long enough to um  to take on. Yeah and and y'know in the culture that I came from the suburban Australian  y'know  anything older than thirty years  particularly in in Perth y'know usually gets the bulldozer y'know. So um and I and I was also writing at a time when Perth was being n knocked over in the  sort of glut 'n' orgy of the eighties.

 You mentioned Ireland and and that of co that m ma m makes me think about language and makes me think about  y'know wonderful kinds of language and you actually invent some really lovely Australian words at least I think you do invent them otherwise I've led a very sheltered life  in Melbourne. All these years  like water blur for tears and water lap and prawn kick describing the movements of a river uh are they fishing terms or did you make them.

 No no they were just making it up I mean I was I was homesick and I was in in an Irish winter and I was in a tiny little cottage out in the middle of the bogs  um I w I was just I was just y'know m making it up I had a I had a an old um dictionary of of uh Australian vernacular but uh it just felt like there wasn't en enough in it to satisfy my great longing so I just made made words up.

 Oh they're w they're great words and it it's almost like the Germans do y'know where they combine  different things and stick them all together.

 Compounds yeah.

 Compound words which are really very efficient. As you'd expect.

 But they do they do irritate the reviewers of the T L S though . S they get a sort of brogue wearing tweedy sort of chap  um y'know from Merton College or whatever who who just y'know just cannot cope with the fact that you've made words up it's all y'know it's morally wrong.

 Yes we t.

 Well they probably had trouble with Joyce didn't they  as well.

 Yeah that was that's probably a different story.

 We're talking  with Tim Winton the book is Cloudstreet this is Australia Talks Back on Radio National in just a moment we'll come to your calls and by the way there is still one spare line if you're very fast one-eight-hundred  eight-oh-two-three-four-one  talking about the Australianness just before we go to the calls Tim  I think it was uh Joseph Olshan in the New York Times book review who who  though loving Cloudstreet observed that the structure of the novel was and I'm quoting . How did the Australianness of Cloudstreet travel in translation because the book's been translated widely.

 Uh ve very s surprisingly um it it's probably the book that's y'know been  ah the m y'know the the widest travelled uh uh of of my work I mean it must be a nightmare to to translate. It's only now uh just being translated into French quite y'know quite late in the  piece when all my other books are have already been translated into French  uh p people seem to take it on in the same way that um y'know there I was a boy in in Perth in the seventies reading Faulkner I mean  talk about impenetrable and y'know d deliberately uh opaque um I think if you can read Faulkner or if you can read at least a bit of Joyce then um the y'know there's hope for a book like Cloudstreet.

 Yes let's go to  some calls.

 I was just gunna can we  can I just ask one little little question.

 Yeah go on.

 What about things like carn and y'know sh y'know some of those Australian words um like .

 If they sound like  they sound like other people's English though y'know people people kind of know what  y'know if you say carn it'll out loud uh in in the  context of a sentence.

 You'd have to kinda  whine it though wouldn't you.

  Yeah well I I did a few whiny readings in my in my  years touring the book.

 Anyway let's get some calls Sandy sorry to interrupt.

 Bangalow New South Wales first stop and Catherine hello Catherine.

 Oh hello um Tim  I'm actually a teacher of the n uh the novel and I thoroughly enjoyed it reading it  but it's incredibly complex when  we actually try to explore different dimensions of it  from listening to you you may not have had any of those intentions and I'd like you to elaborate on that a little bit but my question is with regard to  the spiritual aspects of of the text which    there's a lot been ri written about it and I'm wondering if it's only on reflection that you're aware  of all of those um aspects to it or were they intentional  and do you think that you were talking about  an aspect of spiritualism that existed in that era that is lacking today or  would you like to comment on that.

 That's it's such a it's such a big one uh. I'm I'm not sure that um y'know au Australia was a m a more spiritual place in the year of the um of the novel um from the forties to the sixties I mean I don't think Australia has every been a particularly  spiritual place under our current um um ah incarnation I mean obviously I think the interesting thing about Australia is it's y'know probably the the most irreligious culture implanted upon perhaps the most spiritual continent um on the globe and it's it's interesting and people like Patrick White y'know  who tr n trundled down that trail a long time before me were  were writing about the strange anomalies between y'know this  mm brooding ah rich  spiritual landscape and and a culture that was es essentially about shopping and conforming. Um I suspect y'know we're probably we're probably exploring it a little more now than we than we were then. Um as to what I was trying to say in the book I'm look I'm really not sure I think ih a lot of it was accidental I mean I'm  I'm not a completely unconscious writer but um the people in the in the books say the kinds of things that that ih that the characters I had imagined said and I wuh y'know they were just saying the things that humans say. Um some of those people are spiritual and  others are y'know  purely purely material purely for the y'know for the moment.

 Catherine thank you very much indeed for calling us Catherine from Bangalow in New South Wales.

 .

 And now Suzanne is with us too um from Balmaring in Victoria hi Suzanne.

 Hello Ramona. Uh ih it's interesting to hear a spiritual  quality mentioned because I've found it very I've found Cloudstreet and uh Dirt Music and other books of Tim's very earthy  very Australian uh and you've now two of you have mentioned  a quality in his writing that I find  and that is e especially in the early part  it is James Joycean. I I felt this is like Ulysses it's flowing the it was just a continuous flow  and I found that uh really interesting th were you aware of that Tim.

 Um n no to be honest I mean I I was aware that it was flowing and I was enjoying that but I've never actually read uh I've never read Ulysses  and I've certainly never read Finnegan's Wake. I mean I've I've ha I've had a a look and thought oh my god this is y'know too hard for me . And I love the short short stories um but I I  y'know ih after the short stories Joyce sort of lost my interest the sound of it and the music's good but um uh ih it's probably like y'know for me like opera y'know you're you're quite happy for it to go on as long as the doors are open somewhere . And you can  you can you can make a quick escape. Um.

 It's very Australian. You're you're writing uh can only be rij written by an Australian.

 Yes.

 Well y'know wuh puh well puh perhaps so but ih honestly my my influences um were much more American than I  suspect people realise I mean I I I really was a  I really adored Faulkner and and and I guess that's a y'know it's an American Joyce I suppose. Um  just that y'know at least in Faulkner at least f three out of five pages you know what's going on roughly  you you're sort of in the ball park at least.

 Yes. Suzanne thank you  so much for calling that's Suzanne.

 Thank you.

 And Tim you've got a lot of water in the book so maybe that accounts for the flowing quality. M y'know you like to spend time on the water.

 Your cuh yeah I I think I just yeah the setting coulda done the job for me. Um but I I think it was y'know I was trying to write um as I had been trying to write for the y'know the ten years buh before that when I was publishing all the other novels and stories I was trying to to write more and more and more the way  I spoke and the people that I grew up with spoke and the people that I knew spoke and um I particularly remember  ih y'know when I was in school th those novels that we did get to read  were tended to be even the Australian novels tended to feature a very very British diction um  where you knew damn well that the person who wrote this book if you met them in the street they would speak much more like you than like their book. And there's nothing wrong with  you know w with y'know changing your diction and projecting uh as a writer but for me personally in terms of where I came from and  and what I felt close to and inspired by were  writers who who whose l language was uh uh y'know even in a confected way which you have to as a as a writer you have to you have to y'know manufacture something but whose writing sounded like their their speech and the speech of  of ordinary people um at least in other kinds of people in the book.

 Yes we're talking about Cloudstreet we're talking with Tim Winton Ramona Koval Sandy McCutcheon and you and the you in this case is Linda in Sydney hello Linda.

 Hi Sandy and hi Ramona and hi Tim. Uh Sandy when you told us recently that Cloudstreet had been voted the most popular Australian book I knew I had to read it  and so I've only just finished it.

 Oh very first time.

 Yes.

 Oh well done  yes.
'
 And I found it a very special book and in fact I found many themes running through it  and I'd just like to comment on one of them and then ask Tim a question  if I may. Um well I found the theme of the search for an authentic Australian spirituality through it  and uh many of the characters  kept saying uh I wish I had something to believe in  and um I could see at least three different ways that this longing was expressed firstly there's Sam Pickles who believed in luck and uh amusingly his sense of security came in accepting bad luck as the norm for his life and then secondly throughout the book there are traces of a decaying Christian religious faith  uh Lester Lamb says grace at meals uh though quickly and uncomfortably  and his wife Oriel reads her bible though she wonders if it makes any difference to what happens to her and there are the amusing descriptions of the church weddings where the bridal couple and families are very out of place  and then many quotations from the bible amusingly applied to nonreligious activities. And now the third expression of this search for an authentic spiritua ality is a more mystical and dreamlike  even pantheistic. Um and it's expressed in many ways the unnatural glow on the face of Quick Lamb and his brother Fish. Um Quick's visions of water in the middle of a wheat field and thinking he's seeing his brother Fish riding across the field in a boat  made from an oranges box  and most strikingly and I won't give away too much of the story but the voice from the sea that responds to Fish's twenty year longing and tells him he'll soon be a real man.

 Yeah but Linda what's your question.

 My question is Tim.

 .

 I mean you've  you've jus you've just passed the P H D standard.

 I wanted to explain  Tim um where where I was coming from to give so you'll understand the question. So Tim in Cloudstreet were you saying that Australians are searching for an authentic spirituality something to embrace that is greater than themselves something to believe in.

 Uh I suppose I suppose I was I mean I mean and thanks for your ah for your um your statement as much as your c question it saved me reading the book again  it was a real good refresher I mean a as to it's te it's terrific I remember a whole lot of  things in the book now. Um   I I think I don't think I was saying something I think I was probably just admitting something and it was it was a kind of um the people in the book are c in a sense you know thinking aloud and um  and I I th yeah I think um and it was at a an interesting time I think yeah in my in my grandparents' generation and the beginning of my parents' generation perhaps  um y'know the sort of the mm the the imported version of Christianity had had kind of uh  had withered and there was no  real engagement   with um with y'know with Aboriginal culture and spirituality  and the only thing that people could really believe in was the army. Um y'know the first A I A I F and the second A I F and uh of course  in recent  years that seems to have been a resurgent um religious belief in Australian politics.

 Exactly.

 Um y'know from um Kirribilli down but um.

 So you think we're still searching for a auden authentic Australian spirituality.

 Yeah I th I think we've I think we're trying to find something that that that works for us and I think  that's probably not any y'know pure tradition I I mean I I was y'know influenced by uh my Christian upbringing but um  I think the sort of important kind of yeah the sort of ang the sort of Anglicised version of Christianity that that we had sort of only applies up to  a very short point y'know to your long white socks so.  The other   that's going on.

 Linda thank you  very much for that. Tim can I just bring ih something else that I mean struck me talking about the spiritual thread through it y you make some very strong statements about  self determination and humanity and the the quote that I that s I guess stuck with me from the very first reading and really grabbed me the second time too was  I mean this is a is is pretty strong stuff isn't it.

 Yeah and it's obviously it's coming from uh y'know the the matriarch of the family y'know Oriel is a just a  a sh she I think I describe her somewhere in the book as like a y'know little boxy sergeant major  I mean she's the she's the person who  is the least passive the least content um person to  to just take what fate um sends her way. And in a in a sense she's almost trying to y'know she's trying  she's trying to th throw herself higher by her own bootlaces which y'know is a  is a y'know ex er.

 Difficult task.

 A dih yeah it's it's a task that has a sort of li lih has its limits but uh it's just I think it's just a the passion with which she refuses to to take uh things um uh it it was interesting to me and of course for me it was  it was born out of y'know having heard lots and lots of conversations y as a bored child in the sixties under the  the dining table um particularly at my grandparents' places. And that that that that was the other thing I was doing  um in terms of language just r y'know revisiting the sounds of all those voices those sort of  disembodied voices uh uh ab above the  the dining table while I just y'know looked at people's varicose veins and looked up  ladies' skirts y'know that's exactly.

 Buh.

 As one does yeah.

 Bored child that y that  that y'know and that was the that was what I was capturing and obviously I was y'know I was overseas at the time and  a little bit of longing there as well. But I like .

 Well if you're longing to to speak with Tim Winton about Cloudstreet which is the most popular book for two-thousand-and-three at the end of last year when we asked um you to tell us about what your favourite Australian novel was and you said Cloudstreet  give us a call on eighteen-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one  eighteen-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one I'm Ramona Koval and talking with Tim Winton and Sandy McCutcheon  and let's go um to Sydney again to Jennifer hi Jennifer.

 Hi um  I'm currently studying year twelve at the moment and we've just started Cloudstreet and I was just wondering if I could ask a few quick questions.

 Are you doing homework .

 Are you writing an essay.

 No.

 We're not  writing your essay for you.

 No um we just wrote an essay on why we thought Tim Winton should have won the prize last year so I've already done my essay. But I was wondering um Tim what was the purpose of including magic realism like why why did you include it.

 I I didn't make a conscious decision ah uh uh about it I just uh  I just enjoyed it and a and it sort of just it came out of the story that I was telling and once I once I'd sort of stumbled into it I found that uh it it belonged in the story so there was n there was never any conscious um decision to  to step outside the bounds of uh y'know naturalism um because I y'know I'd been writing in that sort of s sort of odd kind of hybrid way for for a long time. W in a w  when I grew up the the books that were purely naturalistic seemed to lack something about life t uh to me and um and I think y'know once I read at least in Australia once I read Patrick White I understood that y'know that someone else felt like that too.

 Thank you very much indeed that's uh Jennifer in uh Sydney and this in also in Sydney is Jane hello Jane.

 Hi um this is actually quite interesting 'cos Jennifer's in my class and.

 Oh.

  Oh it's just she's kind of just stolen my theme of question but that's okay. Um I was actually wondering if you could talk a bit about Fish's character and the kind of involvement of his narration through the novel and in the sense that it's from about three different perspectives.

 So Jane sit down  get your pencil out and I'll put you on hold so that uh that we can just let Tim go for it.  Thanks indeed for calling yeah.

 I think I'd better get my pencil first. Um uh it took me two years to realise who was telling the story um of of Cloudstreet so I wasn't really aware I realised that that the kind of narrator that I had was a little informal um he 'n' 'n' he or she was a little bit all over the place. Ih m n and and so it was it was a delight to finally be put out of my misery um and I think I was in Ireland or France at the at the time to actually know who was telling the story it was a l great burden um off my shoulders and I felt like I knew y'know 'cos um y'know being the writer of a book is a little bit like being the reader y'know you're you're not you're not uh you're not in c n entirely in control and  and there are plenty of surprises for you but  ha having having Fish tell the the s the story in in in in effect in the time that it takes him to drown um y'know it was a is a pretty artificial kind of uh structure I suppose but um it was it was what I it was what I was stuck with once I felt him in in the water and telling the story I w I sort of wasn't gunna let go of it. It didn't seem like a good idea but it seemed like seemed like my idea  and I was gunna stick with it .

 It certainly works.

 And it it is interesting that Cloudstreet appears on nearly every year twelve reading list in the country though   but it is it it's odd y'know those no it's a great book come on Tim I know you're being modest we all love it though.

 No no I'm not just being modest it's it's y'know it's hard and hard to read and it and you don't write books for to to be obstacles in in people's path y'know in order to get their piece of paper at the end of twelve years of school I mean  oh I mean I'm glad glad of the royalties obviously but uh y'know it's it's.

 But the kind of questions that obviously teachers of English will ask like y'know what was tr writer trying to tell us here or  y'know was this book about redemption and Christianih I mean all these things are really weird for a writer to to listen to aren't they.

 Yeah and also they ast they they they have a sort of assumption that you are um setting out to write a novel to tell people what sh y'know what's what  uh or what you think and in a way y'know for me writing uh a novel uh which is a sort of habitual act for me after all these years  it tends to be more about finding out what I th what I think rather than um what uh I think everyone else should hear.

 But isn't it isn't it amazing Tim the the number of things that a reader will see in a book and patterns and connections  that never consciously really occur to the writer.

 Yeah uh and it's kinda wonderful really you r you realise that um there are y'know I mean if there's a if there's this book Cloudstreet there are obviously a lot of Cloudstreets 'cos they're they are quite separate experiences for people y'know and there are obviously many things in common and  people have very divergent uh uh readings of it and uh I like that uh um if if if a book has enough room to  t t to let people  inhabit it and br 'n' breathe in it and bring something to it and um and I th I think it's it's been some kind of success.

 Yeh theh you are interested in the way y'know families and those in them cope with tragedy an accident where a man loses his fingers or where a child is drowned and resuscitated and  isn't the same as before  and the trick is to keep living. I mean whe when you write . There's sort of the taste of living in that isn't there an an an admiration at wih with the adaptability of people.

 Yeah I I think so I mean I I I I y'know I've I've had criticism over the years for y'know my kinda melodramatic streak there was lots of accidents in my in my books and um  m I I suppose it just comes from y'know having been a uh the son of a  policeman and and having been privy to and exposed to y'know a lot of a lot of accidents all all the violence in my life wasn't internal it wasn't in the family it was  it was it was uh around us in terms of what my father was  coping with ih ih in his job. Um and of course y'know I had a great uncle who lost his fingers in a  in a winch on a on a boat so um y'know you just you just use what you  what you know and what's in the air and y'know sometimes it's useful and sometimes it's not.

 Well Reg at Saint Andrews I believe hasn't read this book and I'm not sure if we're gunna be very happy about but he he wants to make a point of nonetheless. Reg.

 Yeah um first of all nice reading Ramona.

 Thank you.

 I haven't read no I haven't read the book y'know I I hear so much about it it's one of those things y'know you like a film  you hear everybody talking about it and you think oh God I'll pick that up one of these days but you don't. But what um what I wanted to ask.

 Well good on you for holding out.

   What is what I wanted to ask Tim  and uh reluctantly because talking to talking to writers sometimes you feel that  a lot of their ideas not ideas so much but a lot of things come from they know not where  I don't know whether this applies to Tim or not but what I what I was conscious of during that reading particularly during that reading I don't know about the rest of the book  was. And although I don't know Tim's book I know uh Dylan Thomas's Under Milk Wood very well  I couldn't help feeling that there's a a strong  sort of relationship uh between the the use ih in the way the uh words were being used  duh does is Tim conscious of this or or.

 It's called good writing I think .

  Yes indeed but   Tim feel about um Dylan Thomas himself.

 Oh uh I've never read nuh Under Milk Wood I've heard I've heard uh bits of it um uh read uh on the radio or in the in in the classroom but I never actually st studied it or never  read it um from beginning to end but um y'know it's it's it's beautiful stuff and Tom y'know Thomas was a  y'know a almost as good a poet as he was a drinker.

 .

 Yes let's go to Jason in Brisbane hello Jason.

 Hey hi there. Uh Tim I've got a question about tragedy it seems to be an underlying theme with a lot of your books. And.

 Yeah sorry about that.

 Uh no don't be sorry about it because I think my wife and I both love love your stuff. Um and you seem to write such beautifully tragic or tragically whatever way it goes around beautiful stories. Tragedy what is that a big sort of thing in your um like I w I don't wanna get too personal but where does this underlying theme come from. 'Cos  e every one of your books.

  Uh well it's um I I I. It certainly doesn't come from personal experience it perhaps it comes from the sort of the  the the obverse y'know I mean I've I've led y'know a probably a charmed life and  it's either uh it's either guilt or anxiety that something   some of these kind of things are gunna be visited  upon me um  . Um buh uh y'know ih but I guess it goes to y'know having having seen a l a l a lot of tough things uh as a child and as an insomniac I mean in a in a house where your father comes home  tells your mother things about the day that you weren't supposed to hear um  but y'know you live in a few asbestos houses in your time and um y'know they're pretty thin walls . Uh and tha and also just just being awake. Y'know I mean it's very hard not to  it's it's very hard not to see how how tough and and tragic life  can be I mean unless you're y'know completely anaesthetised by y'know um   muzak and and television.

 Can't sing the blues unless you've less you've actually lived I know that's  obv you've heard that before. Uh but you seem to write tragedy just so beautifully  uh maybe it's just a good mind I guess what what.

 Jason we're gunna have to leave it there 'cos we've got a board full of calls and it's bursting but look thank you so much for that . Let's uh let's uh put uh him on hold and uh just remind you this is Cloudstreet we're talking and we're talking with Tim Winton and this is Australia Talks Books Ramona.

 And now we're going to Bruthen in East Gippsland to say hello to Mick hi Mick.

 Hi there.

 Yes Mick.

 Tell us what you think.

 Oh well I love Cloudstreet um and I love the vernacular especially uh words like Catholick. That's spelt really well I think.

 With a C K at the end.

 Yeah excellent. Um look I had a more general question and that was where where is Tim heading um in terms of his writing. Um y'know I love the way he writes about landscapes and um I was wondering whether um there was any plans to maybe come over to the east coast and uh immerse himself in .

 In the rest of Australia .

 The East Gippsland uh landscape or perhaps uh north Queensland would be a good uh good one as well.

 I've heard of all these places um  but um. Uh e I mean I um. That's probably a good question I mean ih w I don't really know where I'm h headed in my work at the moment I'm just writing sh uh short stories as a kind of relief uh from from the novel and and as a kind of different kind of pleasure  But ah I mean I I just write I ah I suppose I've traditionally rih written about y'know things mm close to home and and I sup in a in a way I don't s think of the books as as discrete I see them all as part of this sort of aul uh alternate world that I have the  luxury of um of um knocking together over  over several decades y'know if I if I get a couple more. Um so look who knows maybe there's a there's a there's a Noosa novel in me but um. Uh I think I think the odds aren't good.

  One-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one is the number  we're talking with Tim Winton don't forget you can also  go online to the discussion at A B C dot net dot A U forward slash R N  follow the links to Australia Talks Books find the discussion page and leave some thoughts there. One-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one to Metung in Victoria  and uh Fiona thanks for waiting Fiona welcome.

 Oh hello how are you.

 Yeah good.

 Yeah hello to you all. Um that's interesting the the chap who's just was it Nick or Mick um from Bruthen. He's only about uh probably fifteen kilometres from me 'cos I'm we're we're East Gippsland people so we're  and and I.

 You're all on the phone down in East Gippsland.

 We are. We are  I would echo um I think it was Mick so y'know like could you please come over here and look at East Gippsland Tim Winton and and write some .

 Is this an attempt by by Gippsland to hijack the man.

  hijack .

 Don't you understand he doesn't have a  passport for that part of Australia.

 Listen we we we've got a cultural desert over here so we we we need people like that here  we need musicians and writers. Um.

 Mate I mate I make cultural deserts wherever I go . Be proud of that.

 Come over here mate. Look I suppose I've just uh rung I I haven't rung 'cos I read Cloudstreet for about oh fifteen years uh I or ten or ten years I suppose. And um I read it and I read it in one sitting. I was Cloudstreeted out when I when I'd finished 'cos I I felt it was a wonderful book  and my daughter who was then I suppose seventeen at the time um then took it up and read it and she did the one sitting too  and so we were both Cloudstreeted out  and.

 God I wish I could write it in one sitting .

 Be be handy wouldn't it Tim.

  pretty amazing wouldn't it   but the thing was that  the the the weird stuff you know the the blackfella who was always lurking about. The black man   who was lurking about  and there was there was a particular scene that I've I've just picked yih I've been made to pick up the book again and  and look for it and was it Quick was um he was out in the water and there was a ih th th th there was a  a man.

 Is this the day he caught all the fish.

 Yeah.

 Yeah.

 He caught all the fish and the figure of a man walking on the water and it made him laugh. Um and he he sort of he s he said oh he's on a shallow bar. Y'know 'cos he's trying to get defensible. Um and this black man just sort of appeared and and when he got to the shore the blackfella was waiting for him in a pair of calico pants and a British  jacket  um I thought  that was pretty interesting. And then the black fella sort of lurks through the you know like again though the book and  um and there are these these really funny sort of ghostly appearances that happen  and it was really strange because I said to my daughter I found those bits um uh I like I'm I I believe in ghosts and things like that. Um but I I I found they were out of like a bit out of context or something or I didn't feel comfortable at I didn't understand.

 Fiona then sit down s.

 And she  and she  as a seventeen year old  said they were f they were fine they they they were real they just fitted in they were that was what happened.

 Well let's get a response from Tim because we have as I said we've got a boardfull and that was uh that was an extraordinary uh rave from you Fiona I really enjoyed it  . Tim how do you respond to that.

 Oh I doh I m don't quite know how to respond I mean if it doesn't work for somebody then en I mean there's nothing I can do about it it's a  it's it's a f it's a failure in the writing or it's just a bad connection. Um and y'know upf obviously that's a  bummer. Um.

 Ah   but the daughter loved it. Yes .

 Okay let's  let's let's go to to to Ruby in oh no w that was Ruby wasn't it.

 No no Ruby's next.

 Oh the Ruby's ne oh Ruby in Maryborough in Queensland hello Ruby.

 Hello Ramona hello Sandy  and Tim. Tim I've just coincidentally finished reading Cloudstreet three weeks ago. And you're a national treasure it's one of the most beautiful books I've ever read. I loved the poetry. I had great interest and concern in all the characters and um just commenting a bit more on what a previous caller said  about  how you write tragedy so beautifully. I felt through reading the book that there was so much joy and love love of life uh interwoven amongst the tragedy.

 Well thank you  . Um I dunno what to say really um  Sandy.

 Yes alright well that sound that was a very good response. Yes .

 I just didn't quite know .

 Let's g let's go to Tom let's go.

 It's just so nice of you I just. It's like getting birthday presents.

 Yeah look Ruby thank you so much for calling Tom in Toowoomba another man who hasn't read the book Tom.

 Yeah well.

 Explain yourself.

 I I have um I'm meant to um at the moment I haven't read your book but I intend to.

 Good.

 Uh when Ramona read out that first starting of the book  within the first twenty to thirty seconds I visualised  that she was talking about the Swan river the in Perth   and picnics near Como because when I was a just after school during the late forties you were describing my family and picnics on the river in exactly the same way as I remember it. And that was quite a surprise  so that's why I rung you just 'cos ih 'cos it just struck me so. It's uh just so vivid.

 Oh thanks it's it's it's all in the reading .

 Thank you very much Tom.

 Oh that's right it's all my fault yes actually Tim y'know h seeing Chickery Chick chalah chalah. That song my first publicly performed act in kindergarten  it was very yes it was  very good to see.

 Damaged a h   dah damaged a whole string of kids for years .

 That's right what did it mean Chickery Chick chalah chalah.

 No id no idea I mean I I used to hear it a lot because my uh my grandfather was a a uh a uh in vaudeville well y'know he was a vaudevillian whether how far into vaudeville he  he was although I think he um he warmed up for Roy Rene once um  uh in in in Perth uh ae so we y'know all that nonsense singing and the the kind of strumming of the back of frypans and um y'know jumping around in baggy pants uh there was a lot of that uh in in the family and um and my my  my uh my grandparents sort of had a family band as as well and uh and my old my grandfather sort of managed to s scrape into the uh second A I F um because of music. Um he was he was really too old but he got in the band and um  and that was his sort of second lease of life. And for a lot of people I think y'know once the war was over ih everything went back to normal it was a very dreary place   um which you can see why they had some y'know religious beliefs in the A I F.

  Well Susan's on the line from Mildura in Victoria hi Susan.

 Hi how are you how are you all.

 Good.

 Good.

 Um I read Cloudstreet and I've like read The Riders and I loved them both but what I want want to say is I'm not an academic and not an intellectual and I I absolutely loved both the books  and I absolutely adored Faulkner when I was young too as Tim did  um but uh prih he said he understood four out of five pages I probably understood one  but I still loved them and I still read them at one sitting and I still um  got so much out of them but I don't really necessarily feel that I need to to understand everything does Tim feel that's would he be disappointed if people didn't understand all his books.

 No not not at all I mean um w when you think back to Faulkner 'n' 'n' 'n' 'n' I even I think p y'know people who who love Joyce it's not really necessarily even  um th information it's music that that people will take away and um  if somebody if somebody's carried by the music then  um then uh y'know that's sort of a feat er uh uh uh in it in itself just to just to sweep them  away. Uh obviously you hope to to sweep them away in a in a  in a faintly coherent direction but uh it's hard enough just to  just to just to m uh move people and um  and it's music that does that.

 Tim can I can I just ask you something uh about the way you see the world at the moment because w when I r r read reread Cloudstreet that wonderful innocence of the Lambs and the Pickles seems almost from another age to me anyway. When you look around Australia now what are you seeing what kind of place.

 Oh I I'm not sure how how innocent the the the place was and there's a certain viciousness to to innocence um at times I mean uh even the even the scene in Cloudstreet where  where there's sort of complete uh ignorance about the fact that um the Aborigines didn't have the vote and they're all sitting around talking about y'know which you you voted and ih the complete  almost callous shock that people had there's a certain  there's a certain nastiness to innocence um so I mean I actually don't wanna be too nostalgic. Oh I dunno I dunno if Australia's that much uh less innocent I think perhaps there's a lot of wilful ignorance but um that's not quite the same. Um  uh I dunno I think we y'know in a way we joined the world 'n' and had second thoughts. Um and I I s still think Australia is a y'know deeply conformist um culture and you look you look at the  the politics at the moment and you've got an opposition leader  desperately trying to say something that sounds different but really isn't different 'cos if you said something that was different then you'd be running the risk of  frightening the frightening the horses.  And you wouldn't want to do that.

 Yes frightening the sheep. Yeah look  we've been  yeah Tim we need to wrap it up I just want to say th s so much uh y'know thank you for so much for coming on and spending the time with us uh. Again it's been wonderful and um we look forward to your  writing of  short stories and um  and um I'm sure Ramona that you look forward to that just as much as I do.

 I do absolutely . Hurry up  get them out.

 Books and writing what's coming up Ramona.

 Well this week um we enter the mind of musical genius in the nineteenth century world of Clara Schumann  who was married to Robert  who was y'know composer p uh performer  uh but he was very very mm difficult man to live with he had a had a big mauh mental illness and she had eight kids and you know it's a very wonderful novel by um Janice Galloway so Janice Galloway Scottish writer will be joining me 'cos I spoke to her at the recent Perth  festival of words and ideas  and she's great you know she is really  fiery and full of fun.

 Do you listen to.

 And we like that.

 Do you do you listen to classical music Tim.

 Ah yeah I um I don't I don't care for it to be called classical music and I think as soon as I'm I'm a little um like s like some f y'know if you call it classical then it's y'know it's dangerous it's sort of  pushing pushing it away from the listener but yes I I like I like classical music.

 Yes. Coming up uh on Australia Talks Books a very different book next time Ramona.

 Yes um in March we'll be talking about Sue Woolfe's book The Secret Cure  and uh it's about autism it's also about science um the story of Eva the cleaning lady in a small Australian  scientific laboratory  um she was a junior technician who worked there years ago and nobody knows she's on a secret mission to  discover a cure for autism for her autistic child  and it's about also a a reclusive man who  spies on her but loves her deeply  and it's a it's a very moving novel so you've all got to read it and then Sue Woolfe will join us uh at the end of March last Friday in March  to talk about it and take your calls.

 That's  The Secret Cure and let me just remind you books and writing with Ramona is on at five past one on Sunday afternoon and repeated on Tuesday afternoon  at two-thirty have I got the times right Ramona.

 Perfecto.

 Aah good and what a treat having Tim on the program today it's been so good and Ramona having you back thank you so much for  for for coming back and working with us again and I look forward to talking with you and Sue Woolfe  next month.

 Me too.

 That.


"
"

 Good morning how are you.

 Ih is it true you've won the uh Australian Children's Book of the Year four times.

 Um I got four gold medals .

 Well that's good enough for me.

 They might be fooling me .

 I'd also like to welcome Kerry White she's the author of a massive third volume  just released of the Australian Children's Books A bibliography it's a an amazing tome. She's also a compiler of a website  that is the holy grail of Australian children's literature The Source good morning Kerry.

 Good morning Julie.

 Uh before we get into talking about these books and and Marcus's marvellous comments  w why do you make such a huge bibliography I could barely carry it into the studio. What's the purpose of a book like this.

 Ah I I guess it's best described as the equivalent of a map a literary map so it's for scholars and researchers and everyone who can sort of find their way through the field so  as well as this huge one you're looking at now there's two of similar size that  map the field from seventeen-seventy-four and of course you're possibly thinking there were no Europeans in Australia in seventeen-seventy-four but  nor children's books  but uh Marcie my colleague who did volume one includes books that uh that thought about um adventurers to this great south land. And then we go right through to the end of two-thousand well I carry it through to the end of two-thousand in volumes two and three.

 And is it true that you've you read every Australian children's book that's published every year.

 Yes. But that's not for the bibliography I just look at the books and describe them and and look at the artwork and so forth. But for The Source and for the two subject guides I publish back in the nineteen-nineties yes I do.

 An and The Source is now on the web   essentially what's that.

 Um it's a wonderful resource mainly for schools and libraries um for children and adults to use where they can go in and find out about books both Australian and overseas  and we're particularly dedicated to poetry. And so um for example if you had a v had a very harassed school librarian nine o'clock in the morning  and a teacher runs in I need some poems on angels for example . It does happen I can assure you. She'll just leap onto The Source type in angels in the poetry section and get a great list of poems some of them in full text if they're outta copyright that's just one example of the many things you can do on The Source.

 Well Kerry I think your credentials are now firmly established  as a as a a gee whiz expert on children's literature in Australia  uh I'd love to get your reflections to kick off our discussion  on how things have changed and perhaps you could start with some of the school readers of the nineteen-sixties and then we could  leap forward to uh some of the more contemporary works uh tell us about the nineteen-sixties . Is it your childhood.

 Yes because that's a really only one I can speak with  with any real information. I was at a large primary school in Wollongong called Keiraville public school.

 This is south of Sydney.

 Yes about eighty kilometres south of Sydney. Um it was at a time when a lotta people were moving into Wollongong so kindergarten I remember was packed out. We didn't have a school library we had the mobile bus from the city council library come around and I can't remember if that was fortnightly or monthly and each class would just file on and pick out their books I remember  getting the brumby books and um various others but you had very little time they just wanted you on and off tsh tsh tshoo . And uh.

 So th so there was no library actually in  your school.

 No library at all. And we'd have class sets of readers and I've brought along just a couple of what would have been in the school and you said before that you actually recognise one of them.

 Y yes can you describe one just to  to remind people what we're talking about.

 Well this one called My Storybook Number Two it has a very plain green cover with just black and white drawings on it and it was produced by the Department of Education of New South Wales and the text is very simple it's um.

 Just uh just read the first page.

 Yeah I'll just read this one it's a little story called Pal. .

 Pal being a dog.

 Pal being a dog indeed . Was Pal dog food back in the sixties  I can't remember.

 I don't know this could be the origin of the name.

 It could.  and here's mother in her um pinny making a cake in the most gorgeously neat and tidy kitchen I think I've ever seen in my life. Um .

 Now now we can probably break the reading 'cos I think we've got the drift I mean.

 Have you got that  it's not too complex.

 Well what does that book tell us about the world of those children.

 Well this wuh I think would have been given to children uh around five or six maybe more like six actually because I don't really remember being given readers in kindergarten for example. Um so it was very structured. Um obviously written with the intention of teaching. And that was its simple intention  we'd look at them now with a certain amount of nostalgia which makes them more attractive to us like this one actually has the original uh a picture of the original model of the Holden. So that um sort of interests us.

 It has a  nostalgia but as a as a a a a person who thinks so much about Australian children's literature now how would you assess that   if someone took that into today's classroom.

 Well it would teach people to read in the end but it's not very inspiring  and uh when you think of the lack of other literature we had to draw on as well  um one thing that we had that was very very nih important was New South Wales School Magazine  which is still going and in that you had extracts of novels both by contemporary Australian writers you had poetry and original material a lot of  uh current writers had their start in School Magazine like Robin Klein and Anna Feinburg um.

 So an important source of uh quality reading.

 Yes.

 And and are there equivalents of these sorts of simplistic readers from the sixties  and the enriching uh department publication magazine in all states and territories in Australia is this a common Australian thing.

 I think so I know there was a similar Victorian magazine. Um that people still talk about from those days and and is now going in a different format. Um and I'm not really fully aware of any other states but these sort of readers were everywhere. Um I have another one called the Whitcombe's Story Books which were everywhere  in Australia and New Zealand. Um and yes they they just speak of a completely different attitude to teaching reading .

 And and in essence what is that attitude.

 Well it was just the basics. And um  I don't know if you remember learning to read I don't. It just sorta happened.

 Well I remember things  called the S R A Reading Laboratories   they were all these sort well well f for the modern listener what are they  'cos they were I remember them in the corner and I used them a lot.

 Yes I did too. Um they were just a box and it came from the U S and there were uh reading cards and you moved through levels you started at level one and went through all colours I think there were colours and and numbers.

 Yes it was definitely colour coded.

 And you would just sorta start at a level and I know in my class we were very competitive and we'd all try and race through the lot because you'd read a little passage and then you'd do comprehension questions do you remember that.

 Uh uh very vividly what I'm getting from you is ih if we're talking about the sixties 'cos what I'm interested in is the change to now  and and what it tells us about our approach to children and childhood. In the sixties it was very learning orientated around literacy  rather than firing the human imagination.

 That's right I think the idea of fired human imaginations was left up to family and friends that like that was a personal thing uh and so the the school wasn't providing um fiction as such and so at h you depended on what happened at home. Um I know in Wollongong we did have a a reasonably good children's library but that had only started in the forties like it hadn't been around a long time and I and it became better resourced by the sixties it was quite good but not everyone had access to that I presume.

 Well well let's leap forward then  to that young Marcus the ten year old we heard  at at the front of the show.

 What a marvellous reaction.

 Well clearly able to critically assess a wide range of books to understand the sort of action he wants  even the sort of covers and topics he wants  what does that tell us about the modern child and the I suppose the resources that they have.

 Yes well he just was so sophisticated in his reaction to he knew exactly what he wanted and he I I was really very impressed yes.

 He he sounded like an informed consumer  now.

 That that's a very good description.

 Well well it implies to me he's got more choices it's not the  the van pulling up at the school that doesn't have a library that you run into grab a book and run out  he's choosing  from a menu.

 That's  indeed that's that is the big difference with with the past and the present like now there is a profusion of books. It is um so much easier for children to access books and uh as well as the library specialist libraries everywhere. Schools I don't think a school exists now that doesn't have a school library it's just unheard of. Um and the the books are bought did you realise oh uh that last Christmas the sales of children's books went up twenty-seven percent so.

 Well if we're speaking book sales that's an ideal opportunity to bring in my next guest Gary Crew because he sells very well  and if you've just joined us we're on Life Matters on A B C Radio National Julie McCrossin's my name and my guests are Kerry White  the author of a massive bibliography of Australian's Australian children's books and we're discussing Australian children's books and how they've changed over the years and what that tells us  about childhood and our approach to reading. And also joining me now from Queensland is Gary Crew now Gary  is a very successful writer give us your assessment Gary of the current uh choices for children when it comes to books do you wanna focus on a particular age group like uh perhaps young teens.

 Um  yes uh Julie I think that in many ways that choice is um diminishing. And we could argue this diminishes because  if we take the analogy of um T V with um y'know real life T V what do you call it um reality T V. So one show's popular so we'll put on three shows so we'll put on seven shows so by the time you start watching T V at night you've got y'know the whole program is taken up with  hideous forms of reality T V interpretation. What happens therefore is often in the trade um a very successful genre of book um can grow and grow and grow like Topsy um.

 Can you give me an example of what  you mean.

 I can. Um you might get y kind of your books with bum in the title. So okay and there are quite  a few of those around I don't care about that that's cool I like kids who say bum actually . Um but what happens is while the originators of this uh concept m are are very might be very good at it. Lesser lights uh join in uh on that uh bandwagon and you end up getting pretty y'know crummy books as  a result.

 Are you saying that we're somehow in our  marketing efforts uh reducing the sort of intellectual and imaginative content of books for young uh young teenagers.

 Uh I think that's very possible. Yeah I do where I mean ask any teacher these days. Uh I think they'd say that they're fairly uh familiar with the expression of dumbing down  um of materials given to children. Can I just go back to one thing Kerry said which fascinated me um I'm sort of geriatric I'm fifty-seven  I went to school I started school in nineteen-fifty-three. In Queensland. Which some might think is a scary concept  but  we had the Queensland School Reader and ironically quite different from what Kerry faced in Wollongong in the sixties  the Queensland School Reader was squarely based upon great literature principally from Victorian times.

 Uh I think Kerry was actually saying the New South Wales Department of Education school magazine was also a great source of good literature.

 Well that's true. And do you know while it must've been dreadful for the teachers to have to uh excite a ten year old with that material  I mean y'know we we had things like um  Horatio Defends the Bridge uh we had excerpts from The Cloister and the Hearth for goodness sake. Um.

 And can you remember your own reactions as a young boy Gary.

 Well I I think I'm a freak um.

 Oh but no we we  love freaks here  on Radio National .

 Well I'm an author and I I lecture at a university. So I was hardly typical I don't think. It was the meaning of life and what Kerry did  say and I utterly agree with was that in those readers like S R A which I taught for twenty years which I did come across later were so impoverished in imaginative realms. The reader we were given was not it was just a glorious richness of literature. And I truly believe this is a great thing that I carry with me through my y'know intellectual and creative life  that younger people uh obviously working in a university in creative writing I'm teaching people as young as eighteen. They don't have. They haven't got that lovely wellspring of riches that was given to me through my primary school.

 And Gary is that partly because we now target uh in our publishing industry the market of the different ages of children  whereas in my childhood uh I can say tell you in my early teens as a wide reader I was heading off to George Orwell and Graham Greene and Jane Eyre and all the rest of it.

 Indubitably. Look you said at the beginning we'd like to talk about Australian stuff. At the age of fifty-seven I as I am now when I was little I had a couple of options let me explain some stuff. The Magic Pudding I thought was most excruciatingly boring thing I ever saw in my life. I actually saw it on stage and I thought it was boring right. So well that I'll handle that one quickly  but the point I'm making is this I had two options of things I could read basically Enid Blyton who's not Australian I know  but my preference was the Australian Ion Idriess. Now Idriess was a journalist come writer. Who specialised in stuff about the Torres Strait and headhunters and um y'know that sort of thing. His books were on the bed beside y'know my parents' bedside table and because there was such a dearth of books for children. Um I just moved to Idriess. And again I don't think it hurt me.

 Mm on Life Matters this morning we're discussing children's literature especially Australian children's literature  and my guests uh successful writer Gary Crew  and Kerry White author of the Australian Children's Books A bibliography a massive tome and a she's a gee whizz expert on children's literature  I'm keen to come to your calls our talkback number one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven  love to hear of books that lit up your life as a child or your assessment of of books now for children and I might go to Lynn in Ballina in New South Wales good morning Lynne.

 Good morning Julie.

 Thanks for waiting on what.

 Not at all.

 What would you like to say.

 I would like to say Gary at uh fifty-seven being geriatric is a laugh I am eighty . And I have no grandchildren uh so I know very little about current uh uh children's books. But there were two books in my childhood that truly influenced my life. Now don't laugh. One was Pollyanna. None of you uh may have read it it was about a little girl a daughter of a clergyman who died and all her clothes came from the poor box. But she could put a positive slew on whatever happened to her.

 I couldn't live a day without Pollyanna  I just wanna let you know that Lynn.

 Thank you thank you thank you Mrs Tittlemouse it was lovely and she taught me the power of positive thinking. The other one was What Katie Did  and for the information of your listeners.

 Cultural cream.

 I . A little girl who disobeyed her father swung on the swing in the barn and broke her back and was bedridden for X months. She was surly and sullen and uh uh put off all the visits her brothers and sisters made to her until one day an aunt came along  and said we have to change your attitude and ah she prettied up her hair and  and prettied up her room and uh put a smile on her face and Katie became the core of the family. Uh with visitors and flowers and so on. That was change your attitude and people will change their attitude to you.

 Lynne thank you so much for ringing a and I and we'll cane Gary Crew for suggesting fifty-seven is old if you're eighty  . Thanks mate thank you.

 Okay .

 We'll travel to Melbourne now because Sam has rung in with a with a spirited defence of Biggles accused by a ten year old earlier on Life Matters  this morning of not having sufficient action Sam your view. Good morning.

 Well good morning Julie when I was five years old I thought Biggles had plenty of action. I thought I thought Biggles was fantastic and I was extremely miffed when this wonderful wonderful full set of all the Biggles stories was given to my brother who had absolutely no interest in reading  and theeh these books were deemed unsuitable reading for me .

 Now I'm a girl who stole her big brother's train set Sam so we're on the same wavelength here but what was it about Biggles have you become a member of the airforce at the Australian Airforce after reading Biggles.

 Uh no not not exactly um I I think I I I grew out of Biggles reasonably quickly but I think listening to some of the uh discussion this morning  it's just struck me and this is as quite recently now that I'm an auntie  watching sort of my uh nieces and uh nephews now starting to sort of grow up and getting to primary school  just how much when you are small the adults around you influence one way or the other  the books that are available to you. And that's whether they have books in the household whether they will allow you access to those books in the household or whether it's by introducing you to libraries.

 Mm Sam thank you. Thank you very much for ringing in I might just come to my guest Kerry White  on that question because you you feel that these days  in a way we m over control and over influence children's reading. Can you speak to that.

 Oh absolutely. Every book that was mentioned then I read as a child and here I was saying on the one hand there were no books to be got from school but I'd somehow got my hands on all of those titles and hundreds of more. I never went out of the house without a book. And I used to drive my family mad my I remember my grandmother and I'd be urging her to read the latest Enid Blyton mystery the mysterious whatever it was with the monkey and the little boy and so forth. Um.

 And did you sort of range like a chook on whatever you could find.

 Everything  I read whatever I could get my hands on  and I guess I did miss having a mentor you know someone who like um with Marcus earlier his mother led him onto Deltora Quest which he turned out to adore. Um I just went as like a chook pecking everywhere everyone's house I went into I would search their bookshelves. So I would go from reading um Enid Blyton to reading Evelyn Waugh  it was a very mixed diet.

 Now contrast that with today I was at a home last night having dinner with a mother of four girls  who when I said this was on the radio this morning insisted I bring in  Sandy Beach by Bob Graham Greetings from Sandy Beach and Magic Beach and My Farm from Alison Lester these are  illustrated young children's books . Uh mad that I these must be discussed and it was very clear that she was reasonably directive an in what her children had access to.

 Um adults are now very um uh knowledgeable about children's books. Um there's more professional interest in the area. There's always been professional interest in teaching children to read but now ih it's in all areas of children's books. I think it is over controlled like you said before I think there's children need to be given a certain amount of freedom in all areas of their life and in their imaginative life most of all . Um but it is wonderful that people are passionate about them and looking at those books that you just mentioned you can see why. They're just beautiful and uh everybody enjoys them mm.

 One-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven is our talkback number this is Life Matters on Radio National Julie McCrossin with you  and we're discussing children's books let's take a few more calls  and then we might hear uh some readings from some more contemporary Australian children's literature  but Hazel has rung in from Melbourne good morning.

 Good morning Julie I thought you might be interested in a slightly different angle  um from the point of view of an author because I think one of the things that uh readers do now is  they send fan email  but not just to the author because most authors have websites they actually send it to the characters. And I think that's an indication in the electronic age that uh uh books do cross the barriers um  um a as the author of The Hippopotamus On The Roof Eating Cake  that hippo actually gets fan mail that has to be answered so I think that's one.

 Just tell us about the title of that book again the hippopotamus one.

 There's a Hippopotamus On My Roof Eating Cake  yeah that's  twenty-five this year but I I the point I wanted to make was that electronically that's how the readers often respond. And I think I'm I I was fascinated by the earlier uh examples that have been mentioned 'cos I've read most of those too and as a self confessed readaholic I still read in the bath but I don't tell librarians that  and I think that um one of the other aspects might be um that  writers um uh uh readers have problems with the writer they they they're not too sure um one of the questions I got was how can you write like a bloke and uh the the point of view of presenting both for male and female readers is something that's come up a great deal and I think one of the areas that  there's the greatest interest ih  in young adult section is in the exotic sec uh settings I think they're interested in areas that they haven't been themselves yet. It's a second hand experience as a young adult to read things.

 C can I just ask you Hazel before I let you go you you're the author of the book about the  hippopotamus. Do you answer the the letters  to the  hippopotamus.

 Yes I think all and I'm sure Gary Crew would agree with that all children's authors see it as a responsibility to answer I just find it a bit challenging changing um  changing genders and characters so often but um yes  it is a challenge.

 Thank you very much for ringing in. Uh Gary I might just come to you again Gary Crew a a children's author in Queensland  I was reading last night your book The Inner Circle and I thought I might just talk to you a little bit about it because we can  bring in uh fiction for slightly older readers. This is uh well tell us the in in a nutshell what the story's about.

 Well for a start it's twenty years old. So it's like me talking about wearing flares  so it's a bit scary. Uh it's about two boys one uh indigenous boy and one uh white city boy  who meet uh they're both essentially uh homeless or from dysfunctional families uh and establish a friendship. Um they become as we would call homeless today or they squat  uh in an old power house where they set up kind of life for each other and eventually um they realise that their loveless lives um have no fruition or no no no future at all.

 And and t would you agree that it reflects that uh more contemporary trend albeit that it's a little old now  of trying to address for the young reader  the some of the tougher issues in life.

 I think so y'know the remarkable thing um. Hodder publish that book now  and I have said to them don't you think it's past its use by date. And they the publishers constantly say no no no it's still selling. Um which is somewhat embarrassing but y'know somebody must like it somewhere. But it still addresses issues that are unresolved. Uh in youth. That issue of alienation for example.

 A and a very frank exploration of the breakdown of a marriage and the impact on a young  man.

 That's right and it happens y'know it happens all the time.

 Could I contrast that Gary I've got a a book in my hand you may not have seen yet I think it's about to come out  Maxx Rumble Crunched and it's all A F L   uh footy stories  there's there's not a lot of words in it there's a huge  uh illustrations o of footy . A and it's it's clearly designed for the reluctant boy reader . I wonder what you think of these books.

 I think there is a very real place and I'll tell you why. What you just said um about the illustration is hugely important  to particularly to young males. I don't want to really gender this conversation but there is absolutely any teacher will know any librarian would know  that young males are attracted to visual. So if we want to turn young males on to reading part of that attraction is to give them one of two things. Either a high visual content or a high intriguing non fiction content. E G psychic phenomenon um y'know dirt bikes rally bikes football. And I think that part of luring children into reading um means that they will remain there.

 Mm what I'd like to do if I may is uh come to our callers in a moment we've got a b a b a board filling up one-eight-hundred-oh-two-five-nine-double-seven  of people wanting to talk about Australian books that excite them. Let's hear just a a a moment of readings from some very contemporary  Australian books and we're going to s uh hear a little bit from Paul Jennings also from Ruth Starke's Nips Eleven and Phillip Gwynne's Deadly Unna starting with Paul Jennings.



 A reading there from Phillip uh Gwynne's Deadly Unna and before that Nips Eleven by Ruth Starke and a and a moment from Paul Jennings his Unreal series  and on Life Matters this morning on Radio National we're talking about Australian Children's literature  my guests are Gary Crew very successful writer from Queensland  and Kerry White compiler of the Australian Children's Books A bibliography volume three uh a series of massive tomes that cover all Australian children's books. And let's go to some of our callers Goldie from Ringwood has been holding on good morning.

 Hi.

 Hello what would you like to talk about.

 Oh look I w um particularly as a teenager was a bookaholic and um I had a unhappy childhood and I just um disappeared and talking about books that take you other places I was very much into  things like John Marsden Tomorrow When the War Began which is hugely popular. Um a.

 What's it about.

 It's what it is is it's about a group of teenagers and they're sort of ah fifteen sixteen I think  and they're starting to be uh aware sexually and having relationships and they go away on a camping trip  and while they're away this war happens  and their entire town and all of the world as th far as they're concerned has been annihilated and um and th and or people have been taken away and imprisoned  and so they h set up this reconnaissance team and they are stealing tanks and  they're making bombs with stuff from their parents' farms and it's just amazing. Um and I lah I loved them also um Robin Klein and Gillian Rubinstein fantasy  um going somewhere else is important to me.

 Yes tell me more about the the fantasy and why you found it so attractive.

 Um it was that sense of um being in another place disappearing into a world that felt different that made me  feel like I wasn't where I was um and maybe sometimes that's a little unhealthy I think  um I guess in a sense I wasn't in touch with reality very much it wasn't a pleasant reality I wasn't popular at school my homelife was unpleasant. But also just that magic of that what if this could happen what if there I could be a hero like in Tomorrow When the War Began what if I could go to another world or find an alien and who's wants to learn from me another language and  all this stuff it was just  in intriguing I think.

 A and Goldie how old are you now.

 I'm twenty-five.

 A and what are you reading now.

 Um well I'm actually doing English lit at uni this year so I've just finished reading Jane Eyre an accompanying novel Wide Sargasso Sea and I've loved them. Um find them fascinating I must say I read um the Pollyanna books as well . And I read Anne of Green Gables I'm s  was addicted to them.

 I'm just so pleased Anne of Green Gables has cracked a mention  'cos she changed my life.

 Oh me too. She sh I I for me that was almost fantasy as well 'cos it was so different to the world that I lived in.

 Yes.

 Uh I've I've got a all the little accompanying books 'n' used to cook up her recipes and .

 Goldie thank you so much I think if if if anyone's captured the joy of reading it's you this morning  thank you very much . Thank you. Uh Liz from Coburg good morning.

 Good morning she sure has. I also remembered I read the Green Gables  Anne of Green Gables but the book I was calling about was The Family Conspiracy by Joan Phipson.

 A and what's that all about and why of all the books have you rung in about that.

 Well the I was my my mother bought me this book I think it was the first book  that I ever owned myself and it actually won the Australian Children's Book Council Book of the Year in nineteen-sixty-two. And it's um about a a f a a family a country family who  um need money and all the children um go on their little projects to raise money for their mother's operation. And um I think I suppose I love the book because it um  it it's about making do and resilience and and um children doing things.

 And Liz do you have children.

 I do I have four children.

 And so how do you approach this question of of their reading we were discussing earlier do you direct it and try and shape it or do you let 'em uh rove about.

 Well they do what they like now 'cos they're very they're they're twenty-five to thirty-two. Um but I read.

 I I think they're probably old enough to choose.

  I think they might be. But they I read to them like hours and hours. Uh I read to them all through their their childhood and they're all  um book lovers . All of them book lovers even my son who had a great difficulty learning to read  he loved books even though he couldn't read them.

 Uh because you read them to him.

 Yeah yeah  and he'd get his brother to help him read his younger brother to help him read and he loved books he'd ha passes books on to me now and says read that mum.

 Liz thank you very much  for ringing thank you. Uh. 

 Thanks Julie bye.

 Thank you Katie's rung in from Sydney good morning.

 Morning.

 You've got very prolific readers for children as well.

 Yes and I was um yeah my older daughter is a an amazing reader and actually started to worry in about year two at school that she would read every book in the school library  which she basically did. Um I mean she didn't actually read them all but she read every book that she was interested in and end up hah having to go onto adult books quite young. But one of the things that  I really I learned when when she was little  was from my mother in law who just who was interested in teaching children reading  was just to expose not to be directional not to direct them into what to read although but 'cos I always loved the Alison Lester books and used to read that to the children  but she would go to some store and buy what a whole rae h all the Dr Seuss books or all the Dick Bruna books on y'know knock down prices  and just send them to to the kids  and they just there was just always this wealth of rih of reading material. One time she bought these horrible books that you could press a button on the side and a nursery rhyme would start to play with a really tinny sound and I just  thought oh I I didn't want them them to have them. But they love they just they m just read everything  and anything.

 Katie thank you so much ring I'm afraid we'll have to go because you appear to be speaking to us through a tunnel  uh but I'll take one more call and uh then I'd love to uh uh ha uh have a listen to some of our classic Australian children's literature we have a little taste of that for you  but Sally from Sanctuary Point has rung in good morning.

 Oh good morning yes. Um like Kerry I was at Keiraville school one of my many schools in the sixties. I'm a former teacher and now tutoring and I just wanted to speak briefly although they're not Australian literature in in defence of the S R A kits.

 Now we should just remind listeners who may have joined us we were discussing earlier these uh  oh a reading kit system  that was in the primary school uh uh classrooms of the sixties and and some sharp things about their barrenness was said earlier what would you like to say.

 The difference is that they were informative they weren't neccessarily imaginative and I'm sure that a l vast amount of my nat current general knowledge  and interest in in very eclectic interests  came from reading those S R A kits where you skip  with no apparent reason from why dogs have spots to um y'know nuclear power with no political correctness whatsoever .

 I love that no apparent reason because I guess teachers these days are more obsessed with context aren't they.

 Oh we use it all the time and we try and integrate everything and it's we try and attach meaning to everything whereas each S R A card was a discrete unit  but I was fascinated nonetheless.

 Mm Sally thank you very much for ringing and I'll just go to Paul from Ballina in northern New South Wales good morning.

 Morning Julie great to talk to you.

 Yeah thank you.

 Uh just ringing probably I've got the typical male story I read my first book when I was twenty-one . Avoided all the books at high school and uh the first book was The Exorcist and I couldn't put it down  and I've been a an avid reader ever since.

 A and what sort of reading are you into now.

 Oh it's very eclectic um poetry  through to science um fiction and a lot of biographies.

 And Paul is it possible for you to  look back at your childhood and think wh why you were so resistant as a younger man.

 I don't really know uh maybe it was a cultural thing a macho kinda thing but I know that  when my son was young I read to him every night I thought maybe uh he he might be different I'd help him y'know be a reader and and really he's never taken up uh the interest in books.

 I suppose.

 He's now twenty-two.

 Righto uh well a question that interests me is what happened when you were twenty-one why suddenly pick up The Exorcist.

 I can't remember it's too long ago .

 Well thank you for ringing Paul because I have to say normally here on Life Matters when we have these discussions  our uh our uh callers are fifty-fifty men and women and it's been noticeably female dominated today.

 Yeah yeah I know it's often the case.

 Righto well thanks for ringing.

 Thanks Julie.

 Uh Gary Crew in Queensland uh I n you said earlier you didn't want to gender this discussion  and yet uh ih it has been a remarkably female call in hasn't it.

 That's right. Uh a d a serious issue Julie is this. Rightly wrongly indifferently we find reading and promoting reading for children is seen to be part of the stereotypical female's nurturing role. And that is a terrible terrible travesty. And we've seen this in the range of callers I was so delighted I've been sitting here actually waiting for a man to speak y'know . But that is the case.

 A and in your   readership are you  are you are you attracting boy and male readers to your range of books.

 It is my first and highest priority. If I have a priority other than creating imaginative worlds. My highest priority is to reach young males.

 A and is there any way your publisher can in any way indicate  who is reading your books is that a hard thing for an author to know.

 Not my publisher that's not their role but when I visit schools that sort of thing uh you you know. Uh and I do know as I said before while that lovely little boy who spoke earlier who's name I've forgotten.

 Uh Marcus.

 Marc marc Marcus  uh spoke about action I hear that connection. I also do know that that visual thing um is the big thing with boys.

 Wh what do you mean.

 The visual element of a book illustration or whatever. Any librarian will tell you you take a group of boys into a library they'll go straight for Tintin or Asterix because they're they're visual they're they're full of like comic pictures . And boys seem to like a higher qual a higher degree of visual  and a lower amount of print text.

 Let's go to Barry from Melbourne who's rung in I think on this exact topic good morning Barry.

 Good morning yeah exactly that when I started school  at the age of f uh five in nineteen-forty-seven  and the first primary school I went to was till nineteen-fifty-one and the boys all swapped comics and they were currency. They were they were currency you know if one comic would be  two for one if it was Superman against Captain Marvel or whatever. And um uh girls read books and boys read comics and uh it's exactly what you're speaking about we were all attracted to the visual and uh I can remember Tom Mix and Roy Rogers and all American comics  but uh that was what boys did in those days anyway.

 A and Barry can you remember the Classic Comics.

 Well for us Captain Marvel was  pretty classic.

 Oh I y th there was a series called Classic Comics.

 Yes I do remember those but they were a bit too high class for us. They were English I think. And uh we'd we read the American trash instead  .

 A and are you a reader now.

 I've always been a reader yes yes.

 A and uh and would it be more books now.

 Oh always books yeah  I I went from uh that was primary school I suppose in one once I got into secondary school I started getting into  my favourite book as a kid was Treasure Island I read that about five times .

 I've still got a black spot in my hand right now.

  Good on you.

  Thanks mate for ringing in thank you very much.

 Thank you  bye.

 Uh Kerry White uh the uh author of this massive bibliography of Australian children's books  uh I'm interested in your response to that emphasis on  comics I mean in your bibliography would or or your work on The Source your website would comics or very illustrated books crack a mention.

 Oh yes definitely  there's even a a genre now called graphic novels where um much of the action of the book is depicted in drawings Terry Denton who illustrated Crunched that we referred to before is just  wonderful at that he's done a series of crazy crazy things that draw on myths and surfing and interplanetary voyages altogether in the one book  and there's a whole series and parts of the text that you can only read through like these strange comics that bleed off the page and then go into a bit of text and um. I'm just thinking I think Gary did a picture book that was set up like a comic is that right Gary.

 Yes Tagged.

 That's it.

 Steven Woolman yes.

 Uh tell us about that one Gary.

 Okay uh Tagged is based on a young boy who uh comes across a a shell-shocked Vietnum Vietnam uh vet in an old warehouse where he has hidden. Uh away from the world he is a y'know he's seriously ill this man. And the boy contacts him and the man tells him of the horrific experience of war. I just wanna get this in. What I wanted to do because the comic format or the uh graphic novel format so often celebrated war as the earlier caller said y'know in the fifties and sixties  I wanted to turn that genre back against itself to have a comic that celebrated pacifism . You see what I mean . Um I mean I'm a bit naughty 'cos obviously it still shows scenes of the horror of the war in Vietnam which is a bit seductive .

 Gary I'm interested y'know earlier in our conversation about Australian children's literature you  uh bewailed the uh loss of intellect and imaginative uh power  in some of the books that are targeted at the reluctant reader   and I'm wondering. I suppose is it possible to have these new forms of publication  that are high in visual graphics that muh sustain intellectual and an imaginative power.

 Absolutely.

 Can you think of any examples.

 Oh absolutely have a look at any illustrated book uh by Shaun Tan. Shaun is just Australia's illustrative genius and uh recognised throughout the world as such.

 A and aimed at what sort of age range.

 Ageless.

 Ageless.

 Which is the dream and I keep hearing Kerry say y'know spread this smorgasbord of books y'know. So when you get someone like Shaun and this is my dream too  I would like to think that my books were actually audienceless. And that you could cast them about the lounge or the house and the meandering wandering child could pick it up 'n' see gee that looks alright.

 Look we've got a a a boardfull of calls we're coming up to the ten o'clock news and I'll come to uh some calls in a moment but can I just say  I just read Possum Magic by Mem Fox illustrated by Julie Vivas  last night for the first time which is a shocking revelation. It's about to be uh reissued in a in a twenty-one year version of it and I must say I was totally engaged in an odd way it is ageless even though it's clearly aimed at children but let's go to Peta from Sydney good morning.

 Good morning um I I'm very been fascinated by the last bit of the discussion because I have three daughters and a son and I have despaired of my son ever reading anything but comics or the very very um frugal wuh books which are very frugal in words but he's just read Catcher in the Rye and loved it. Reached year eleven and finally read a book and loved it.

 What a great one to click with.

 Mm absolutely  um but really what I wanted to say was to compare my experience with my children's um I had the privilege of um being in Adelaide from  age six to ten and Adelaide was the best place in the ninety early nineteen-sixties. And uh I remember weekly visit to the Adelaide Children's Library. And we were four children at that time my mother used to borrow we I think it was four books maximum so we took home sixteen books every week  and returned them every week having read all sixteen. And it was the most wonderful magical place and when we'd read all the children's books suitable they bought more for us . And Adelaide library was the the start of uh really our whole family's reading  but um that was partly because you couldn't rely on the school library they had a handful of books and the public library was the place. What I found interesting with my children  was that the school libraries were so good by the time my kids went to school and they brought me books home that I'd never seen and I read with them um John Marsden and  and Robin Klein and uh so many of the authors that have been mentioned in fact what Goldie said was a repertoire of my girls read and it was just wonderful to read with them books they were finding at school and teachers who were providing them. And if I can just slip in we haven't mentioned Storm Boy um yet and I think that's a great Australian um in fact all the Colin Thiele.

 And I should say to people if you can't join us on on the telephone uh today 'cos we won't get to all our calls email us Life Matters at your dot A B C dot net dot A U or write to us care of A B C Radio National G P O box triple-nine-four  Sydney two-thousand-and-one your favourite children's book and why  I'd love to uh have a little reading of them  and also you can leave a brief message please be brief on this uh number oh-two-eight-triple-three-one-four-three-three oh-two-eight-triple-three-one-four-three-three let's go to Shirley from Elwood good morning.

 Good morning Julie. I'm I'm ringing about a book I have in front of me it's a nineteen-fifty-six edition  of The Way of the Whirlwind which was written by Mary and Elizabeth Durack and I can only assume that Mary was the writer and Elizabeth the painter  because the illustrations in this book are just so extraordinary and I remember as a child when I when I first read this book back in the early nineteen-forties  that uh the it was the illustrations as much I've been a reader all my life that was the story itself is also fantastic but  Elizabeth Durack of course did uh um gain a lot of um pos perhaps notoriety is the word but a lot of it media attention  because of her uh painting in the style of Aboriginal people um when she was much older but as a painter when she was young the illustrations are just extraordinary I'm looking at one at the moment  with two little Aboriginal children on the back of a crocodile and the uh illustration says   and that's a b illustration of two of the children on a crocodile  under the water and they're going to visit the old rainbow snake who lives in the underwater cave now.

 Shirley uh thank you so much I'm gunna just try and squeeze in Michelle from Chilton in Victoria Michelle a very brief anecdote I'm afraid how do you get your children to read.

 Well ending on a funny note I've got a nine year old sports mad boy and trying to pin him down to a particular  style of book that would suit him I tried to get him to read The Famous Five which made a fairly big impression on me at that age. And um I have to laugh in the middle of the night  or later in the evening as he commenced reading the book he sung out to me mum mum what author in their right mind would call their kids Tom Dick and Fanny.

  Thank you Michelle for that uh final comment and thank you so much to Gary Crew a very successful children's author who's been with us from Queensland and Kerry White her massive tome the Australian Children's Books A bibliography volume three nineteen-eighty-nine to two-thousand of course goes right back  to seventeen-eighty-four and thank you to all our callers and to Anne Arnold for production news is next  and then we'll have a look at the pharmaceutical benefits scheme.

 One-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one let's go to Melbourne. Anne-Marie welcome to Australia Talks Back.

 Oh hi how are you.

 Yeah good thank you.

 Um I just wanted to put a thought forward about the um cut in um  education and university fees.

 Oh the HECS funding yep yep.

 Yeah. Um  I had a thought about uh another repercussion that no-one's really thought of is that students who've had a free education they feel the urge or obligation to give something back to the community and um I think Brendan Nelson expressed a a worry that his education was paid for by the taxes of the working class  and perhaps if he'd paid for it paid for his own education he wouldn't have actually felt um the freedom or the urge to go into politics and have ideals that he could um work towards. He might've felt more obliged to go and earn some money and   keep his own um.

 Interesting thought Anne-Marie. Thank you very much indeed and uh Ron uh says . Thanks Ron. Sylvia in Canberra hello Sylvia. Sylvia hello.

 Oh it's Sylvia in Sydney.

 Oh are you in Sydney well it sih  I've just relocated you to Canberra . Welcome to Sydney yes go on Sylvia.

 That's the right thing. Oh it's just about the travel . I went to Bali last year and I'm going again this year. My family live there they've been there  seven years. But they keep in touch with the Australian embassy all the time.

 And you feel  quite happy about about travelling in that.

 Yes. And  when I said to my son is it safe he said well is anywhere safe in the world really . It could happen in Sydney. So um .

 Yeah and what sort of people would we be if we let terrorists dictate where we took our holidays.

 Well they they'd enjoy it all the more. Really.

 Yes yeah. I mean it would be a sign that they'd won and I don't think they're gunna win this one.

 Well that's the thing yeah . But I noticed there's a lot more security at the airport in the hotels  at the school . So if people are and they said people are beginning to go back.

 Yes alright look thank you very much Sylvia nice to talk to you that's Sylvia in Sydney. And Neil echoes several other emails when he says . That's Neil and Neil's from Townsville in Queensland summing up what uh several emails said. And by the way if your email does not get read out I'm sure that something similar to it will. One-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one Mark in Melbourne welcome to Radio National nice to have you with us Mark. Hello Mark. No we'll put Mark on hold and um instead we'll head to Fred near Geraldton in W A. Hello Fred.

 Oh g'day Sandy.

 Yes g'day Fred.

 I I enjoy your program immensely.

 Thank you very much. It's a team  effort.

 I'm sure it is. Um what I wanted to say was that uh Brendan Nelson and his  ideology  and the ideology of the uh Liberal party in terms of public education and in terms specifically I mean I went to uni. Um my parents couldn't have  would never have been able to afford to send me to uni. Um and I went there uh and was supported by the state. Um and I find it extraordinary and in fact if you go through the whole realm of all those people John Howard um a Abbot. All of those people were supported by scholarships that were publicly funded and and yet they're turning around and destroying that and  uh I find it  and what really disturbs me is that nobody seems to care is that  everybody goes oh well  pay as you earn.

 But there are there are s there are some exceptions I I got a a a fax today from the the Central Queensland University and I was I was interested in their reason for not raising HECS fees. They're one of the very few who're not raising HECS fees and the reason that the uh the vice chancellor Glenice Hancock put out was that uh to increase fees by as much as twenty-five percent would be a burden to the communities serviced by the university.

 Yes I know but  I mean I'm a teacher  and uh I I know young graduates coming out now are coming out with debts of eighteen-thousand dollars twenty-thousand dollars fifteen-thousand dollars  a and they're only twenty years old they're twenty-one years old. So they've gotta pay that off before they even can begin to think about um uh uh you know buying their house  buying their car and all of that.

 But Fred isn't it isn't it . Yes but isn't it isn't it also uh damning that that a lot of people won't actually go to university now because of this.

 Yes precisely.

 Yes because I mean the the.

  they'll do a run away. No no exactly right.

 Yes. Look thanks Fred and uh you'll be interested in this next email comes from Peter in the Gold Coast hinterland who says . It's a very telling email and uh uh echoes several others that we had too. Peter thanks for sending that. Kim near Narooma hello Kim. 

 Hello Sandy. Sandy uh the government exhorting the elderly back to work. I think that will create a workplace of monkeys. The reason why is they will deregulate uh the minimum wage and employees will uh will pay them peanuts. The ratio of full time to part time work Sandy is increasing you know and  hence a drop in disposable income as it is. For example the pensioners  apart from food  they pay more than their fair share of tax especially the G S T you know they arguably are the biggest consumers of handyman services. Re-allocating a maybe one or two percent of the extremely exorbitant defence budget for example. I mean that should take care of the welfare end of things.

 Thank you very much for your thoughts and uh on the same issue we had a a charming letter from Trish. Uh not sure where Trish was from but it was one of the few handwritten letters we've had in a long time and Trish says . Thanks Trish and uh from there to David uh in Bathurst and David welcome to the program.

 Hello Sandy  how are you.

 Very well indeed.

 Um my comment relates to some obvious misconceptions that are in evidence as far as how much people earn once they have graduated from university . And especially in the case of Mark from Queensland who is a teacher. We did some modelling in the nineteen-eighties specifically Sam Ball professor of education at Sydney University. And we compared what a teacher would earn with a bus driver. And until the teacher did their four year degree bachelor's degree and then did some teaching and perhaps came back to do a P H D they would be fifty-five before they earned the same amount of money as the bus driver . Fifty-five. Now the HECS load now is significantly greater than it was in the nineteen-eighties when Sam Ball did that calculation.

 So would you agree we've got an we had an email from another Peter and he said um . He goes on to say .

 This is correct . And it is even worse than that. At universities where I teach I teach at Charles Sturt University we're no longer competitors with um the school teaching system. They're earning more than than lecturers and associate lecturers  after a very short time in the the classroom. So where're our universities going to end up. 

 That's a very big question. David great to talk to you thank you indeed uh for your time and expertise and Jim in Perth  thank you for waiting welcome Jim.

 Oh hello Sandy.

 Yes g'day.

 Um uh I've been a tutor and um I I wanna talk uh similar to what your last caller is the problems that universities have. But also the problems that students have voiced uh concerning the quality of their tuition . Wuh w what we have here is a a dynamic intp interplay between funding enrolments the staffing and the tuition itself . I don't believe that universities take their staffing adjustments lightly. Um ih ordinarily they'll take on staff if uh there needs to be uh some adjustment to courses that uh requires more work to bring them up to standard with uh what's known in recent research developments. And when the staff are taken on uh they need to be given some contractual security of employment . Okay so amongst these the funding and the enrolments the staffing the tuition uh the staffing is uh ha has got the least lag time  in a lot of ways hwh funding will be oh once a year um enrolment's once a year and tuition is left as wha what's what's uh what they can do after .

 After the rest of it yes. Alright look Jim I'm gunna leave it there th thank you very much indeed for your call Ruth at Banora Point hello Ruth.

 Hi Sandy.

 Yeah g'day.

 Uh g'day just a couple of points  um just regarding the superannuation  um I I'm a mature aged person and I tried to access of my superannuation to pay for retraining and I had to even if I could get it  I'd have to pay twenty per cent tax on it  and I feel that um some people may not necessarily wanna retrain through uni but maybe through TAFE and I think there should be a loan scheme introduced for TAFE courses.

 Thank you very much and  you had another point.

 Yeah uh the other the other point's oh I've forgotten what it was uh.

 Never mind.

  oh just quickly the other thing is about actually mature age people going back to work  when you look around in the community you hardly see anyone over fuh forty-five working anywhere .

 Yes.

 Okay.

 Thank you very much indeed nice to talk to you and uh Karen from uh uh Victoria says . Thanks Karen. Uh a awful lot of people seem to uh to echo that very thought and it seems strange that in this day and age we don't have a population policy or we appear not to have one  and um thank you indeed for taking time to send us an email. And uh let's go to another email which comes uh from um Jim and Jim said and I just wanted to correct Jim's facts 'cos Jim said . This was uh in reference to our story on on travel in the time of terror. Uh . Well we actually checked on that Jim and that's unfortunately not factual. But um it was a nice try. Let's go to Paul in Melbourne hello Paul.

 Yeah speaking.

 Yes Paul go ahead.

 Yeah um on climate change and and the reef uh it strikes me as a a problem that needs a big solution and part of that solution is um I see as biodiesel. And at the moment there's not much biodiesel available in Australia and the problem we have is the government is uh taxing the uh fledgling industry instead of encouraging it.

 Right and what what about other fuels.

 There's a lotta fuels on the horizon but most of them are still fossil based . Unfortunately we we don't have a lot of options um when it comes to uh renewable energy uh hydrogen is often touted as a um a future fuel but you still have to get the energy from somewhere to create the hydrogen. I guess biodiesel allows us to at least grow a fuel grow a canola crop  and turn it into biodiesel and then run it on your car so at least it's renew at least it's carbon neutral so it a si is a step in the right direction.

 Paul thank you very much indeed let me just give you the uh the four pr uh programs again so that if you're trying to get through you've uh you've got an idea of what we're talking about on Australia Talks Back tonight. Will we be working till we drop the whole look at the uh the idea that uh people should put off retirement and and work a little longer. Uh what's it like to travel in the age of terror those travel advisories and whether you take any notice of them uh and uh how they were put together it was a fascinating discussion on the program about that. Is higher education just for the rich and boy did that get a deluge of uh emails and faxes. And how can we save the Great Barrier Reef whose latest report card is not good it was interesting watching uh the rise in temperatures and the the panic that ensued I guess amongst climatologists and then those winds came in and the winds chilling the reef actually stopped or uh um negated some of the damage that was uh potentially about to be done  so uh c the climate actually stepped in and uh and did the right thing there. The number by the way is one-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one. Right around the country and this is Neil in Bundeena  on the sunshine coast  g'day.

 Buddina er Sandy.

 Oh sorry where.

 Buh Buddina.

 Oh Buddina yeah okay.

 Yeah   uh we've just had a cyclone masquerading as a low pressure system go through here.

 Have you just ha uh just shortly.

 Oh yeah the last couple of three four hours.

 Woah. Heading in which direction.

 Uh  it's going it's going sort of down to Kingaroy I think. Somewhere 

 Yeah head heading south.

 That's right.

 I'll I'll look out for it . So Neil you wanted to talk about HECS and ageing.

 Yeah uh th just a brief comment about Brendan Nelson  um these people I don't know about this government they don't seem to think in terms of people they think in terms of numbers. He was emphasising that the participation rate won't go down but what about the effect on the people that are going to have to  you know get these debts . Anyway this point's been made by others so I won't persist with it but with the ageing population  I'm seventy-two.

 Yep.

 And uh I paid my taxes all my life. And including the uh four and a half per cent or whatever it was levy that was uh designed to uh be extracted from us to to pay for our pensions a guaranteed pension. Now I'm still working  um  but the government's  line that it's  a matter of y'know not having skilled workers and that sort of thing is why they want to bring them back it's got nothing to do with it. Look I'm quite happy to work. But  I've got to do it for nothing I have to do it pro bono I'm an anthropologist  mainly because if I uh charge a fee I'm taxed at about seventy per cent. Now if they want us to have an .

 That's out that's outrageous though isn't it.

 Oh it's it's  crazy. It's absolutely crazy and it gih gives a lie to this business that they uh  they're interested it y'know worried about the fact that there aren't people getting y'know with the experience staying in the workforce well  I've got news for them y'know . A lot of us a lot of old people I do a bit of lecturing for uh for University of the Third Age and so forth and  y'know we're happy to contribute. Delighted to. But give us a bit of a go y'know .

 Yes okay look thank you indeed for your for your call. And that's uh Neil from the Sunshine Coast. And uh very similar sorts of views from Joe in uh Greensborough in Victoria who says . And that's uh from Joe at Greensborough thank you. And to Ron just out of Wagga how's the weather Ron.

 Hot.

 Hot.

  I d d wanted t to tell you I my wife and I have just returned from eleven months in the Greek islands.

 Oh eleven months in the Greek islands wow.

 A a a we went uh  but w you you'd land at Athens and you walked in the airport and nearly d d die of a shock.

 Right why.

 Ooh uh there's gentlemen w with machine guns walking everywhere uh and it's kind .

 But wouldn't you rather Ron wouldn't you rather have gentlemen walking with machine guns than have terrorists around the place.

 Yes but can I uh I I tell you the rest of it 'n' then w we go down to Piraeus  'n' we get on the ferry and we uh went out to Ios. And we theh theh theh th then rang up our consulate and said we want to go to Epidaurus and Delphi and Corinth and so forth and they told us what to do and and what not and then we got the bright idea we w w would slip over t t to Turkey and we did and they told us what to do  and then we got the bright idea we would go over to Brindisi  and th we we were uh informed well uh that there were certain re restrictions but .

 So hang on what you're saying Ron is every time before you went somewhere you rang the consulate and checked.

 Uh uh yes.

 Yeah good yeah.

 A and I will say this uh and that the one that really uh we decided we'd go uh uh over to Knossos on Crete . A and when we got on the ferry we'd called into Ios  eh eh eh every second day we called in  the captain lined me up and said was I so and so and I said yes he said this is from your consulate  and this was instructions how to behave and conduct ourself on Crete.

  Oh good on them. Oh I hope you.

  thought it was wonderful.

 I hope you wrote the wrote the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade a really nice letter 'cos it's not very often we hear really good positive stories but Ron I've got a question for you  all last year you were ringing up Australia Talks Back complaining about the weather and and the drought and how bad it was for farmers. How on earth can you afford eleven months in the Greek islands .

 Because  uh uh uh a a we got the r r rain at the g g g good time  a a and g g g g got.

 That was the rain I sent you wasn't it Ron.

 Yeah.

 Yeah yeah.

 And I gotta too tell you something eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh el else. The wool grew well and the sheep prospered.

 I'm glad to hear  Ron have a great weekend that's Ron just out of Wagga who uh regulars will remember last year  was one of our regulars talking about the the drought  Lillian. How are you Lillian over there in W A nice to talk to you.

 Yes nice to talk to you  again. There's one aspect of education that I'm very concerned about  my grand-daughter is rather upset she said there're big advertisements in children's magazines or youth magazines for children to join the military. Now five c uh colleges have closed in California and within twenty-four hours the military are in signing 'em up for packages for the military . Mr Watson returned from Iraq and he said every one but one serviceman from America he'd spoken to had their education through the military and I'm very concerned about this. If poorer people are not going to be educated what is going to happen to them  I know my grand-daughter's really concerned.

 Yes look thank you very much indeed 'n' there are many people who feel the same way. Sharon from Coogee says . Sharon that's a wonderful thought. That's a wonderful thought but it's  it's not quite in tune with the economic rationalist world we we live in but I've  lotta people would sympathise with that. And from there to Amen in Sydney hello. Amen welcome. Hello Amen. No we'll put Amen on hold and go to Anne in Hervey Bay hello Anne.

 Hello there.

 Yes.

 Yes I wanted to speak to two issues the issue of the HECS fees and also the issue of um older workers. I'm um a mature person I'm retired now  but I was also one of Gough's girls I was the lucky person who  uh got a free education as a result of Gough's uh wonderful changes to the education system. I would never have been able to afford a degree without it. Now um I am now retired I would work  twenty to twenty-five sometimes more hours a week voluntarily using my degree in areas that the government chooses not to fund for example bereavement support palliative care  uh community development those areas are not appropriately funded or sufficiently well-funded by any level of government and I'm not alone I know of of many others  that do the same.

 And we have got probabry probably had twenty or thirty emails saying exactly that.

 Yeah.

 So there are an awful lot of people who'd agree with that. Yeah.

 So to say you know that we should be working is we are working it's just that we're not paid for it.

 Yes. It was interesting theh Doug uh from Canberra sent us an email who said uh  just the point you're making    .

 Yes it also touches on the issue of people who are have to um work for their unemployment benefit . Um on on so-called voluntary schemes for which they are not  uh they are neither the qualified nor experienced  um just to I think ih in in a. Okay it's it's an undignified way of saying to people you're not uh worth getting a a basic amount of money to live on  you damn well work for it and  and the work that they do is is very often not um useful to them in even in uh career.

 Anne thank you indeed and have a great weekend up there in Hervey Bay  lovely part of the world Amen in Sydney are you s are you there now. Hello Amen.

 Yes yes I'm here.

 Hello welcome.

 Uh thank you thank you look I uh I wanted to touch on um two topics one was HECS and one was superannuation. Um I'm uh I'm actually twenty-three years old and uh and I attended university uh about uh three years ago  straight out of high school.

 Yep.

 Now there um what what concerned me while I was at university was the number of people that were going there because it um pressures from family to actually attend university complete a degree. Um there was no desire for them to actually hold a university degree other than to please their parents and um.

 Yeah it was just family pressure yep.

 Absolutely  absolutely look I can tell you that um I succumbed to family pressure to actually go to university and look  I was a high achiever at high school and but I didn't know what I wanted to do at university and I went in there wih y'know blindly and I um and I did an I T degree  and um and look it was actually incomplete when I decided to um go into the workforce and look I've I've prospered uh so much from from the learning experience that uh that I had at university and and the skills that I gained not so much in what I was studying but but how to think how to learn just like that uh that email that was written in earlier and that really that was what um uh y'know what I learned from . Um uh now there's there's just not enough emphasis on that 'n' look  um there's there's uh a another point that what that leads to the the number of people going just for the sake of it is uh ih is an inflation in the number of uh students actually uh y'know enrolled in their course studying it  completed and and you've got overcrowded lecture theatres uh overcrowded tutorials and and um a and now they're y'know the universities uh need more funding to to support this this increase .

 So how d uh I mean you've you've pointed your finger to a really important problem Amen but how on earth  do you solve something like that how do you solve the problem of people putting pressure on kids to go to university kids who don't want to or the societal belief that you're not gunna get on in life unless you've got a degree which is  blatantly silly as well.

 I can tell you that if I had a counsellor at uh at high school  that really counselled me as to my choices look in year ten I really uh agreed to people leaving high school when they knew they weren't gunna go to uni when they knew they didn't want to  I was uh completely for people starting apprenticeships because the amount of money that they'd save themselves and they'd have a foot in the door in an industry that they that they love y'know mechanics and hairdressers and the like  these people are they're going to going through year twelve and then going into uni doing some  arts course which they just barely scraped into  wasting their time and their money and uh and in the end they're not really uh y'know applying themselves and and getting any sort of a skill that would that would benefit this uh y'know their their community and um  and yeah look the way around it is counselling at uh at school I think if.

 At school I think that's a that's a good point Amen thank you very much I've gotta move on to Doug in Karratha. Hello Doug welcome.

 Hello Sandy.

 Yes g'day.

 And good show this this week uh  three topics one is em retirement. I've been salary sacrificing now for uh nearly twelve years  and em coming up to my fifties and g I'm seriously looking at retiring in my mid fifties  and that's the lesson I learnt from my apprenticeship in uh many years ago at Midland Workshops where  people worked through to sixty-five  we'd have the big em farewell for them and six months later the uh flags  would be at half mast and they'd die basically. .

 Yep yep. They'd retire at sixty-five and then the funeral at sixty-six.

 Yeah  basically and that happened time and time again but the big concern I have is for my em children. What chance have they got with regards to superannuation especially with the current job prospects where people are the uh standardised long-term employment jobs have gone and people are very much looking at short-term contractual jobs.

 Yes yes.

 And saving for superannuation there's gunna be a nightmare for them . And uh I don't know what we're gunna do about that. The other one is HECS fees. Em I've got a daughter currently at university and I'm encouraging her to go on and do her em honours and masters simply because of the fact that em retiring or leaving uni with a degree really doesn't guarantee you any sort of position at all so  the costs of those are exacerbated simply because to guarantee yourself some work you really have to go on and em do your masters a lot of the time. Um and the third one while I'm on a roll is uh with regard to the environment I heard on your show some bloke talking about em having to build a whole heap of new power stations if they convert to gas. That's not really the case basically all you need to do is retube the the boilers themselves .

 Yeah the the retubing of the boilers yes  we had several people  sent us an email about that yeah.

 And you can go straight into em gas-fired power station at minimal cost and you actually get more efficiency out of them so you increase the efficiency.

 Yep.

 Of the of the power stations. So.

 Thank you very much . That's good to  talk to you and uh have a great weekend let's head to uh Michael in Canberra hello Michael.

 Hello yes uh my point relates to to both uh terrorism and travel and the the greenhouse gases issue  and one of your wuh  your show Earth Beat a number of years ago made the point that um  air travel is has enormous consequences for greenhouse gases and I guess what I wanted to say is that unrestrained um tourism especially through air travel is a kind of ecoterrorism in it's own right  basically.

 Wow there's a there's an interesting thought.

  Okay.

 Yep  thank you very much indeed. Bill in Lismore welcome to the program Bill.

 Sandy  great show.

 Thank you.

 Um yih I listened last night about uh coral reefs . Uh there was there was a woman on the show I think she came from uh A C F or the World Wildlife Fund  I was disappointed that she she dismissed uh population reduction as a possible solution to the problems a couple of callers mentioned that.

 Yeah I I heard that . I I heard that but I didn't hear her so much dismiss it outright as as say that y'know look that's a whole other debate that we need to have.

 Yes yeah.

  you're talking about Anna Reynolds's comments yeah.

 Yes yes that's right. Well can I explain what I mean basically I think that the coral reefs dying is a is a s is is just another casualty of the global impact of humans on their environment  um and you can you can uh divide the or break down the impact of humans on the on the world uh into two factors one is the ecological footprint that is the that is a measure of the the amount of uh mess that each indiv average individual makes  and multiply that by the number of people  now if we were to try and make a su substantial reduction in our ecological footprint it would it would involve a huge and and uh almost unacceptable change to the wa to our way of life yet yet population reduction is actually very easy and very achievable. The answer's right under our noses.

 But why don't we have an aj a uh um a population policy for the  for the country.

 Good point.

 Yeah  yeah alright look thank you for for raising that let's head uh to Elvis in Sydney hello Elvis.

 Uh hello Sandy.

 Yes g'day.

 G'day. Uh the general assumption seems to be that if you want a good education  you need to enrol in a university or some other  educational institution. Well I think you can get a good education by listening to the ABC going to libraries um  probably uh evening classes at uh technical colleges  and uh and uh and the like. Mm 

 Yep. I think an awful lot of other uh of people would agree with that and I know a lot of people uh Elvis in uh in really good um jobs around the place who don't have a university education. Uh it's not the be all and end all of course it obviously helps in a lot of lot of careers. I think doctors are one of them. Let's go go Audrey in Sydney hello Audrey welcome.

 Sandy hello  look I I hope  I missed the barrier reef night and I hope this hasn't been raised but the Democrats  last year uh and before c huh collected clear evidence that um vast areas of coral sea will be released to oil companies and they've been pressing for legislation  to um prevent this by extending the marine park . So there wouldn't be oil exploration .

 Yes I don't think the uh the question of of uh extending the marine park came up on the program last night but it's a it's an interesting one  and one that the Demuh I remember the Democrats raising yeah.

 And it's pretty obvious that it's hard you know it's going to lead to the degradation of the coral reefs I doh I my point is it doesn't matter what party you belong to  just t to keep that in mind and so that the major parties you know take an interest in it.

 Thank you very much indeed that's Audrey in Sydney and Peter in Cairns hello Peter.

 Oh hi mate how are you.

 Yeah good.

 Look I just wanted to support the previous uh caller. I'm doing a masters degree. It's costing about fifteen-thousand dollars . Um there's no way that when I finish it in uh twelve months time I'll be able to turn around saying to my employer I'll have another fifteen-thousand dollars a year thanks.

 Yeah it just doesn't work does it.

 No it's done I mean I'm sure that there is  there are people that do do it for the money and that's fine. But I I think I'm like a lot of people that uh we do these degrees out of personal and professional interest because whether we like it or not  there is only the information in our chosen areas that is taught at that level.

 Yes yeah. Thank you very much indeed. This is Australia Talks Back the number's one-eight-hundred-eight-oh-two-three-four-one and uh we head to Stuart at Glenroy in Victoria hello Stuart.

 How are you Sandy.

 Yeah good thank you.

 Uh love your program um I just had a s an alternative view on this on the HECS fees . Um it would probably cost the government a little bit of money to start with but as soon as the person starts working after they've finished their degree all their tax goes straight to their HECS debt.

 Ah so it's it's actually uh earmarked and um  yep.

 And it it would encourage would free up their  uh taxable income for a start so they'd be able to pay more G S T and uh they'd just would wouldn't be a burden on their income  and y'know with a lotta people they'd be paying four five thousand dollars a year tax to start with anyway once they finish their course so that most people would um have their HECS debt paid off probably within three or four years. They'd be contributing extra G S T and so on.

 Interesting thought thank you very much indeed. Peter in Hobart thanks for waiting Peter welcome to the program.

 Well that's a brilliant idea the last speaker  has had wonderful. Look I I haven't heard your other program nor have I heard tonight I tuned in most recently. .

 Well Peter welc welcome aboard.

 Oh thank you.

 This this is the biggest talkback program in Australia and you've just made it one person bigger.

 Running late tonight . Um I've heard Brendan Nelson justify the charges in terms of  only those who get jobs and have money will have to refund these HECS charges. But not long ago I talked to a university lecturer who said that her classes were full of people who were doing courses but whom she knew would never work because they were doing it for hobby purposes . These were often mature age people and they thought this is great I've got nothing to do I'll do a university course it's most satisfying fulfilling and it's wonderful.

 Yes.

 Now they're not going to pay for it. And they're taking up space time resources everything else. How big is that problem. Is it a significant problem  does it exist. I'm sure it does but how big is it.

 It'd be really interesting to get the figures I mean we've we've had  people send us emails ab s claiming to know these figures and one one  email that came in this week said that fifty per cent of places at universities are now mature age people.

 Right well how can they not know the answer to those questions  when they enter into such a scheme as this  where the I've got two daughters uh approaching yi well one's at uni and one's approaching uni age. And they're going to have this debt  which admittedly won't have to be paid until they earn significant salaries but it will deprive them of everything else that we would have used in your and my time  uh at that stage in our life uh because they'll have this thing hanging over their head.

 Yes yeah exactly Peter thanks very much indeed that's Peter from Hobart. And on Australia Talks Back we uh we're gunna go to Freo and to Fremantle and Paul hello Paul.

 Hi there how are you going.

 Yeah very well thanks Paul.

 Uh look um I just wanted to suggest to people what a uh a program I saw on channel two a few years ago now.

 Sorry can I just ask what topic are we talking about.

 Oh m m global warming.

 Global warming and the reef yep uh yep.

 Yeah uh uh it's just that they their theory was having dug into a uh some guys Americans dug into a a river in South America and and found out that uh back in uh uh dinosaur days or not uh it it probably the the w the same thing we're going through now happened in the past and also w digging down they found that they had huge droughts uh uh uh y'know and .

 Yes I I h I actually heard on the program the other day that um some nine-hundred years ago or so or nine-thousand years ago or so there had been other uh climate events like this. The problem is that uh uh a as was said uh very adroitly by one of the guests on the program that it's uh it's not within the thinking space of the uh either the local environment minister or the local tourism minister you need to think in terms of how does this affect the reef for next year and the year after that thinking in decades not hundreds and hundreds of years but yes true the uh the climate record has changed over the years and shown some some pretty warm spots. Paul in Canberra thank you for waiting Paul.

 Hello Sandy a pleasure. I wanted to talk about uh retirement and uh and an ageing workforce. Um I'll just quickly give you a snapshot of the situation that I'm in. Um I had the experience of being in the public service for twenty years  and the total effect of the way in which the public service is run and I know this applies to large private uh enterprises as well  was that it created a very toxic work environment. Most of the people I know which of uh in all the areas that I've worked in over over the twenty years were just waiting to retire . They couldn't bear the agony of being disempowered in the workplace in all the myriad ways that it happens. And since then I've been lucky I took a year off I gradually regained my strength being away from that environment and at the age of nearly fifty I've reinvented myself I've gone away and done a mature age masters degree.

 Oh got yourself a big HECS debt.

 No I  paid two-th two and a half thousand dollars a unit uh   but of course I could afford it 'cos I was mature age . So anyway leaving that to one side  and now I'm I'm I'm pumped I feel all the energy of youth returning to me I'm making progress in new work environments that seem to be better managed. 

 Yep.

 Perhaps a fluke  who knows but.

 And and healthier environments.

 Healthier environments . But also I guess because I've got a little bit of capital behind me and now I can make the offer to resign  um quite meaningful and I know that I'm no longer in the clutches of people who would just squeeze me dry  I have a lot of energy.

 Fantastic.

 And and so anyway I just think that that does have application to the whole issue of of of a mature age workforce mature age students  um and I've heard quite a lot of debate obviously over the last uh few weeks on the radio.

 Yes.

 And the number of people who've said oh look I'd never go back to work I was just y'know disempowered and I couldn't bear it.

 Yes. And well you're proof that it's not true thank you indeed for calling and we go to Judith in Ulladulla. Hello Judith welcome to Australia Talks Back.

 Ooh yeah   there. Oh right um it's me yeah.

 Yes Judith go ahead.

 Oh good well well I t I've been trying to upskill upskill upskill and I've I've done my this 'n' this 'n' this 'n' I'm up to now um  diploma I've done that 'n' uh 'n' now I'm uh heading for a uh a degree. It really doesn't seem to matter. 'Cos I haven't had the um previous work experience in that field  uh um even.

 So even though you've gone and upskilled you have still finding it difficult to get work.

 Yes  because none of my previous experience even though I've been conveyancing  statistics and and no matter where I was it doesn't uh they all say no no no you can't put that on your resume 'cos it's far too far away.

 Yes. 

 That's ridiculous it seems to me.

 So how long have you been looking for work Judith.

 Oh well looking for work uh well now I'm in in the fifty bracket but  I've done all sorts of things and doesn't seem to matter.

 Yes. Uh all that experience and nobody really cares about it do they it's really sad. Judith good to talk to you Judith in Ulladulla and that's the program for the week. My thanks to all of the the wonderful contributions from from you on the end of the phone 'n' all that dialling and for those who didn't get through well there's always next week. And my thanks to the tireless A T B team this week  technical producers Jim fingers Ussher and Peter doublefinger McMurray  producers Lindy Raine Keng Lim and Andrew Davies and executive producer the grand poobah Gerald Tooth. Who did a wonderful job looking after the program yesterday. On Monday group sex and male sport the unacceptable treatment of women by high profile sportsmen has been shockingly exposed recently. But what does it say about male sexuality. And h why have we come so far from the true ideals of sport. We'll look at that  group sex and male sport. It's a dark topic  but in the meantime have yourself a wonderful weekend with Radio National.

 Eighteen minutes past ten eighteen past nine in Queensland eighteen past seven in Western Australia. Navigating the world of treatment for menopause can be a nightmare. In the last month we've seen the cancellation of a seven year trial in the states  sending more shockwaves through the community. Already a topic that causes a lotta confusion hormone replacement therapy or H R T has been controversial since its widespread use in the early nineties but does that mean it's not beneficial for some people. Menopause is different for each woman  uh some women suffer few side effects during the change as it's affectionately known and uh others suffer severe weight loss loss of sex drive uh mood swings and of course the dreaded hot flushes. So uh how do we make sense of everything that's on offer. To help us out tonight Dr Barry Wren is a guest. S one of Australia's leading researchers in gynaecological research and the author of a book called Understanding Menopause and Hormonal Therapy a Woman's Guide and uh he joins me in the studio tonight Barry good to see you.

 Yeah good evening Tony.

 Well uh let's start out at the beginning. The change the menopause what in fact is it.

 Well it's it's basically only just a time when a woman runs out of her own hormonal uh um production from her ovaries . It begins around about the age of forty-five it's usually completed by the age of fifty-five. There's an average of about fifty-one years for women in Australia. And when it does those hormones which um influence the way cells will respond have just stopped being produced. And as a result of that women begin to deteriorate in certain areas. For some women it's uh disastrous and for other women they just as you said sail through without any problems  whatsoever.

 I I suppose uh menopause is a little more poignant at the moment simply because a lot of women waiting longer in life  uh before they uh have babies.

 Uh exactly so I mean I I saw a lady only today who's aged thirty-five and is just going through the menopause at this moment. Her mother went through the menopause at the age of forty and uh uh her sister also went through uh at the age of thirty-eight so this lady at the age of thirty-five is now just starting her perimenopausal phase. She will almost certainly be completely out of all hormones within the next year and uh she's going to have another fifty years of uh menopausal uh symptoms and problems if we don't do something about it.

 Gee whiz. Uh I I suppose that's a huge shock to her was she planning children or.

 Well it wasn't a shock because she expected something like this. Uh she's already had four children so that's  uh uh she she was quite expecting that she's a very intelligent lady with a university degree and so on and so she was not unaware of the problems and she came along to get some help from this stage onwards.

 One of the first things we need to have a look at tonight I think is the study in the United States  it's been going for seven years and uh it was uh cancelled because of uh the the some recent findings in the last month. Uh a lotta people not thrilled to death with this study uh a lotta people also supporting it. Um can you can explain to us exactly what the seven year study's all about.

 Yeah sh sure Tony there's actually two studies done by the same group it's the National Heart Blood and uh Lung Institute in the United States. Back in early nineteen-nineties they decided that because hormonal therapy appeared to be doing such a great job for women  and helping to prevent uh heart attacks uh osteoporosis uh quite a few other problems  that uh they should do woo call a prospective randomised blinded study. So they recruited women into this study and they were given two types of hormonal therapy they were given either oestrogen plus progestogen or they were given oestrogen alone. The women who had the oestrogen alone were women who had a hysterectomy and the women who were on the combined therapy uh were women who still had their uterus intact. There were sixteen-thousand-six-hundred in the women taking hormonal uh combined hormonal therapy  and about eleven-thousand in the study taking oestrogen alone. Two years ago they released the study results of the first one that's the sixteen-thousand-six-hundred women  and it suggested that women who were taking hormonal therapy at that stage had an increased risk of heart attacks stroke breast cancer but a decreased risk of osteoporosis. Just two years later they stopped the oestrogen alone arm of the study because uh there didn't appear to be any major benefit and there was a slight increase in the risk of stroke. And they didn't cancel it they just said that it didn't appear after seven years to be any major advantage of carrying the study on any further . But there was no increased risk of uh heart attacks there was no increased risk of cancer in that group. So the big thing was why were all these studies showing some adverse results  and why were there differences between the two studies. Well when you look at the two studies there are some major flaws with the way they were structured. Most women in Australia going through the menopause are between forty-five and fifty-five years of age  and that's when they start getting their symptoms and they require some hormonal therapy. The studies in the United States recruited women who were somewhere between fifty and eighty years of age never having taken hormonal therapy beforehand. The .

 So wuh when you say hormonal therapy that's even the pill.

 Even the pill yeah.

 Okay.

 Most of these women uh had uh no symptoms whatsoever no hot flushes no sweats and that was deliberately chosen because they didn't want women  to enter the study with some hot flushes who would either go onto hormonal therapy and find out that they were um participated or not go onto the hormonal therapy go onto a placebo and still have all their symptoms. So all these women had to have no symptoms whatsoever when they entered the study. Their average age was sixty-three years  which was quite considerably almost fifteen years older than the menopause. When we look at their uh demography we find that um most of them were very very overweight and matter of fact over a third of them were regarded as being obese. Thirty-seven percent were being treated for high blood pressure and other cardiac problems. Twelve and a half percent were being treated for high cholesterol levels. Four and a half percent were diabetic. Um there are fifty percent of them were smokers or ex smokers. Now all these factors increase the risk of cardiac disease so you take this group of uh women who had no symptoms with a high risk of having a cardiac disease and give them a an oestrogen by mouth. Uh you might get a slight increase in heart attacks and stroke and that's exactly what they found. It was not surprising and we feel it is .

 So you f believe it was a self fulfilling prophecy almost.

 Virtually so it was a flawed suh it was a good study I must say uh a a very well conducted study but on the wrong group of people. Uh here in Australia most of the women are not in that particular category they're not that old they don't have those underlying conditions.

 Mm. Well uh f uh we'll start up with the pluses um uh mm perhaps you can describe what an average woman who was starting to go through the change would receive. Um as a treatment and what the benefits  of that was.

 W we've already said that the majority women going through the menopause will get hot flushes and sweats and they will have a dry vagina there will be an increase in uh osteoporotic changes. If they take hormonal therapy from the time of their menopause the beginning of all these symptoms then we can be sure they will have relief of those symptoms their vagina will remain moist and the risk of getting osteoporosis will be reduced considerably . The a large group of studies something like about a hundred and twenty that I've looked at which have been carried over the last forty years show that women who take hormonal therapy  from the time of the menopause without any underlying problems have a reduced risk of heart attacks and a reduced risk of uh some of the other major cardiovascular events. And uh this is something which is not shown up in this particular study this study suggest it's adverse . Which is un.

 But you think it's a positive.

 I think it's a positive yes I think it could be made a positive but women have to be very careful about. Obviously if a woman comes into my rooms at any stage at all who has some condition which would suggest that she may have an underlying uh heart attack or problems there I would be very very chary about giving her some hormonal therapy and if she wanted hormonal therapy I would probably give it through the skin or some other means  rather than through the gut and the mouth and the liver.

 Mm now um th they're the some of the positives negatives.

 Negatives hormonal therapy if it's given in an inappropriate way can produce uh things like bloating it can produce some breakthrough bleeding if the uterus is still present. Can produce some breast discomfort that's mastalgia because of the changes to the breast  um they're the basic things which most women will have as an adverse effect and there are some local things uh sometimes taking it by mouth will produce some nausea uh a few problems like that. If you take it through the skin it'll produce some skin irritation. Are suh uh some adverse change but we can always readjust those hitches to suit each particular patient.

 Mm I suppose where we are moving into areas where we're we're not certain and that is the length of uh treatment for hormone replacement therapy  uh because it's a relatively new therapy um I suppose we're we're s stepping off the cliff cliff to a degree.

 Oh uh can I correct you on this Tony it's not relatively new it started in nineteen-thirty-two so it's over seventy years of use of hormonal replacement therapy now. We have a lot of experience with it's use  and um there are now very long m major studies where women have been taking well over thirty years and have a very good outcome from that uh period of time. Matter of fact back in July of two-thousand-and-two when all this  first of the uh major negative studies came out my phone rang hot from patients ringing in  and one patient rang in I just couldn't remember her her history very well but I asked her how long she'd been taking therapy. And she said thirty-six years and I said how do you feel she said great I'm the semi finals of the club championship but I wanna keep on going . Now y'know th ah that's one swallow doesn't make a summer but the big thing is that women can take it while ever they wish to. They need to be monitored the whole time though.

 Mm okay so I mean what six monthly or yearly or.

 I generally see a patient every year when she's on hormonal therapy I probably see her twice in the first year when she starts on treatment to make sure everything's fine. But after that once every year from that point onwards.

 Mm breast cancer is that an issue.

 Yes breast cancer is there's there's no doubt that um women who have breast cancer uh l let me just sort of uh go back one step. It takes a long time for a single cell which has undergone an a series in mutations to eventually grow into a mass that we can actually see or feel. Some people have estimated it may take up fifteen years. If a woman is taking hormonal therapy whilst that uh cancer is growing it'll grow faster and it will show up earlier. This may be a negative or it may be a positive for her  but there's no doubt that women who have cancer probably shouldn't be taking oestrogen.

 Mm it is a matter of fact that as women grow older the percentage of women likely to get breast cancer increases.

 Oh yes it's an age related disease. At the age of fifty there's about one in a hundred women will have breast cancer and it doubles itself virtually every decade from there on so at the age of ninety it's around about fifteen per hundred women will be found to have breast cancer. So it just keeps on increasing every decade.

 Mm is there any connection between breast cancer and hormone replacement therapy.

 Well yeah there is I mean um men get breast cancer at about wuh only one uh man for every hundred women so it's a basically it's a female dominated uh type cancer but that relates to the number of times that the cells are multiplying in what are relatively large breasts compared to a male's breast. So we have a a problem of size and the number of cells which are present  but cancer is a series of mutations and the they're a sporadic spontaneous and sequential mutations which take place within cells anywhere in our body including the breast and hormones increase the rate that those cells are undergoing mutations but don't cause the mutations.

 Mm Barry when uh when you're seeking advice on menopause should you consult your local G P or should you find yourself a specialist in hormone therapy.

 Oh I think the majority of G Ps are fairly well uh aware of the menopause itself. What worries the general practitioner at present is the fear of making a mistake . Of not doing the right thing.

 Can be very expensive these days.

 Right yeah it's a it's a terrible thought and the majority or general practitioners are fighting shy of it right now because of all the publicity. The majority of general practitioners don't get a chance to read all the uh fine detail which I have to spend time reading or some of my colleagues have to spend time reading. So they're not always up to date with all the information but rather than give a negative point of view to a patient they'll give s often no point of view at all they wih they will often say to the patient don't take it uh and it's a negative one without knowing all the facts.

 Alternative therapies uh I mean how do you feel about them and uh I I know you were saying during the news that you wouldn't personally uh prescribe that for anyone. Ah but you you don't feel opposed to to .

 No I I have no opposition to um alternative therapies uh because most of them uh wuh all the research which has been done on them show that they don't have any major effect whatsoever. However if a patient or a doctor believes that they're going to help them  uh from a e m a from a placebo point of view they can be very very helpful they can have people believe that they're helping and that's very good and if people believe in something I think that's there's a great help to that. What distresses me is that sometimes people take them for the wrong reason uh with the wrong expectation. Uh obviously um most of these alternative therapies will not help things like osteoporosis or prevent a heart attack or  do something like that but they won't cause breast cancer and they won't cause some of the other diseases which may be um associated with hormonal therapy.

 Mm menopause is uh as we've said earlier a difficult time for the person going through it but it can also be quite a difficult time for partners and for uh for friends as well.

 Oh yes.

 Um is there anything people can do to uh sort of ease ease that particular time because uh y'know obviously um a person going through this period ih thi they are a bit racked and uh and uh can pass on that uh  unpleasantness to others.

 You you're right I mean but knowledge is power knowledge is everything so I believe that both men and women partners uh people who have any experience their children  should all try and learn as much as they can about the problems associated with the menopause so they can help uh the person who's suffering from the problems understand it or take care of them or advise them in some way. And in a way I mean I'm not trying to uh say go and buy my book but uh what I'm trying to say in my the book which I've just written. I'm trying to give information to women and anybody else who cares to read it exactly what is happening what it all means and I think it's important to gain that insight and that information.

 Mm I mean would it benefit some women to get some psychological help sometimes if they if they feel that they've been impacted greatly by the by the change.

 I I think that um the menopause doesn't produce psychiatric disturbance let me say that  uh m changes to a person's body can accentuate an underlying problem. Now if the woman uh who in question does have an underlying psychiatric problem which is accentuated then it may help her to see some psychological or psychiatric help but basically  it's in the hands of the general practitioner who looks at the total picture sees the patient and tries to decide exactly what areas of help are needed for that particular patient.

 Mm how much fine tuning goes on with the uh y'know getting it right for the patient so that uh obviously you c you can't uh y'know uh one cap fit fits all uh y'know you you require some s s some tinkering at the edges.

 Yeah it's uh look it's very important. I give every patient something like uh about half an hour to an hour to try and find out what uh what the patient feels like what's bothering them and so on like that. And in trying to decide on the type of therapy I take into account their background their physical ah situation other things which may be affecting them. In the hope that in some way uh I can get the therapy regimen right for them. Uh and a lotta doctors do exactly the same but time is the big constraint for this and when you're trying to decide on um a type of treatment sometimes it's much easier for a doctor just to pluck something off the shelf and if that doesn't work say ah well it's not going to work. That's an unfortunate way of doing it . But I always believe in getting a second opinion for all these issues.

 Yeah so quite often uh the first treatment won't be the last treatment.

 It's uh sometimes I've changed my treatment I was looking at a patient I saw today who's been with me for over twenty years and we've changed her treatment six times during that particular twenty years but each time things have got better for her and she's been reasonably happy at this stage.

 Mm  uh the book is called Understanding Menopause and Hormonal Therapy A woman's guide Dr Barry Wren is my guest tonight. I'm just wondering whether uh you've got some questions that you would like to put um it it is a very difficult uh area and um I I guess a lotta people don't fully understand exactly w what they're getting s themselves in for when it does happen. Uh and uh perhaps uh you as uh as a husband or friend would also like to ask a question maybe you're going through a difficult time as your partner  is uh is taking on the challenge of the change.

 And it is now twenty-two minutes to the latest A B C news Dr Barry Wren my guest tonight uh we're talking about his book Understanding Menopause and Hormonal Therapy and uh a second edition just out the first one sold through which is good news for you . Um l I think at this stage we might uh talk to a few people about some of these issues. Uh Carol you you took H R T for ten years.

 Yes Tony it's lovely to talk to you.

 Thanks Carol.

  I haven't got through to you before .

 Welcome uh y y you wanted to talk about why you decided to stop.

 Yes um I was taking Premarin and Provera Dr Wren for for ten years I started in my late forties and um I had uh a very good um gynaecologist who used to see me every six months and uh and monitored me quite closely. But um I decided that uh when this survey came out that I would stop and my G P said I think maybe you've taken it long enough and uh the doctor I was going to retired and I had to go to another doctor and he said the survey was a lot of hooey and that it wouldn't bah matter if I went back on it but I decided not to  but since then I've had hot flushes which are just dreadful but um that's the only thing and so my doctor put me onto patches and I started having terrible periods again so I went off the patches and I didn't have any breakthrough bleeding when I was on the others well hormone replacement therapy. I just wondered what you thought about um um this situation I I have felt that maybe I was on it long enough.

 Carol it's very difficult to uh say y you  should or shouldn't be on it at all you're the person who's in charge of your own life.

 Yes true.

 And um I believe that women take hormonal therapy really to improve the quality of their life . Y'know your life appears not to be as good as it should be and it could be that if you took the appropriate hormonal therapy you'd be fine . Now the patches appear not to have done the job for you  but I can assure you there are many other types of therapies  which you could try  you could even go back onto the Premarin and Provera and you'd probably do just as well on that.

 Really.

 I wouldn't have any hesitation in saying that if your quality of life is diminished then probably you should be back onto it.

 Mm.

 Mm.

 But but how long do you keep on taking these.

 Well it's a very personal thing you see I have some patients who've tried stopping it at the age of seventy and or even as l late as eighty  and their problems all come back  and just feel dreadful and they go back onto it . But they've been on it for twenty to thirty years .

 I was shocked that I would start to have these symptoms I thought I'll be over it all by then .

 Yeah I know a lotta people think that it's only a temporary thing.

 Yes.

 Um twenty percent of women go through the menopause and never have a hot flush or a problem at all . Uh eighty percent do have some problems but as the years go by that diminishes  but at the age of eighty-five  uh twenty percent of women still have all those problems  .

 Something to look forward to Carol.

 Thanks very much.

 No problem whatsoever thanks . Uh Helen um y you're sixty-six and uh.

 Yeah I'm still having hot flushes  um I just wondered how long does it go on for    taken hormone replacement therapy  and I've got these dreadful hot flushes when does it end.

 Well for you it may never end or it may diminish as time goes on  you can never tell now no one has any knowledge as to who will continue and who won't . Um I just say to women who are suffering as you are  to go onto hormonal therapy get under the uh care of a good doctor who will look after you and monitor the whole program for you  and uh just take care of yourself.

 So there's no virtual like they say oh you're fifty you shouldn't be having this  something like that.

 No  I wish it was like that and I keep on trying to remind people that there is no such thing as uh this is just going to last a few years .

 Helen when when they said sixty is the new forty you see  unfortunately it has its complications  good on you thanks for that. Viv um you want to talk about the pill if you're already having uh ye osteoporosis.

 Yeah thanks Tony yeah um I've already got osteoporosis I've had it since I was in my twenties and I'm not at menopause yet I'm forty-three now. But um I plan to go on H R T later on to stop any more osteoporosis later on. But I was wondering should I be on does the pill make any difference to bones.

 No well the pill is really only just another form of hormonal therapy  it's a stronger uh type of therapy it contains uh similar to sorts of progestogens to the um hormonal therapy but the oestrogen that's used is a synthetic one called ethanol oestradiol and uh that's much more potent. But um uh it is  it's very similar in every other way but if you have osteoporosis now you may be better off going onto one of what we call the bisphosphonates they're a group of chemicals which  help uh build calcium into bone and make the bone a bit stronger.

 Yes that's that's uh things like Fosamax isn't it.

 That's right yes.

 Well they wuh they won't allow premenopausal women on it unless they've already had a fracture. Uh and um.

 Well they will let them on it  but the government won't give you the uh P B S uh rebate uh you have to pay the full price yourself  unfortunately. Don't go out and break a bone deliberately to get it. It's cheaper though.

 No no I I do think that I should break my big toe but . Um could I also ask for older people my mother didn't start H R T until she was in her late sixties. And because I was afraid about her having osteoporosis and I suggested and then with the scare she went off it. Is there any danger in take taking it after the menopause is well and truly over or.

 Oh no no I mean I've got women who come to me uh I had a lady who uh was widowed went through the menopause um everything was fine she didn't take anything at all till she turned sixty-eight and she developed a new relationship a sexual relationship and uh she found that the vagina was so dry she couldn't have intercourse and she started on hormonal therapy then and she's very happy  and her partner's very happy now mm.

 Okay thank you very much.

 Thanks Viv uh great to hear from you Joan uh uh you have a a a health issue here you've got uh superficial blood clots.

 That's that's correct yes yeah I had a hysterectomy twelve months ago. I've been put on Premarin six point six-two-five and this is my second superficial blood clot I do have varicose veins would you advise me to continue um.

 Uh I wouldn't give you anything by mouth. Um when uh oestrogen goes through the mouth and the gut it passes directly to the liver ninety percent of the uh oestrogen goes to the liver where it stimulates the liver cells to work better . And part of the production of the liver cells are the proteins which produce coagulation  so taking it by mouth tends to increase the risk of getting a coagulation whereas if you take it through the skin  it avoids that and you can have the benefit of the oestrogen without the stimulus to the liver at that point.

 Oh I see okay so you uh through the skin and not through the mouth uh um and would should I go off the tablets while I have these uh superficial blood clots or.

 Oh yes yes I mean you're I wouldn't take anything by mouth if you've got those uh . Mind you it's it's the deep venous thromboses which we're really concerned about if you've got some superficial thromboses you probably shouldn't take the tablets by mouth but you be d on a patch.

 On the patch oh that's good okay thank you very much for that.

 Thanks Joan great to hear from you uh Judy um you you want to talk about nonhormonal medications.

 Yes um my G P prescribed a something called l Livial.

 Livial yes that's a that's a  an interesting steroid compound.

 I just sorta wondered what kind of y'know long term studies have or has been done or  has it not been around l long enough to have had um that much experience so .

 Well it's been av uh available in U K for oh over fifteen years now so there's fair amount of a sort of background to it. In Australia it's been here for five or six years and uh we've also had reasonable experience with it. Um it's a steroid compound which has uh basically a progestogenic and an androgenic activity normally that's a male type of hormone but it can be converted by uh enzymes in your system into an oestrogen. And uh so it has a weak oestrogenic activity as well and it's quite good and we particularly uh recommend it for women who've got sore breasts and so on like that.

 So it can more or less take the place of hormonal therapy if you don't want to go down that.

 Well it yeah it is a form of hormonal therapy I mean we we  it's it's a steroid the same as uh oestrogen progesterone and tostesterone are steroids so it's got um a steroid activity but it's been chemically manufactured and it's not similar to the um uh it's it's one which you wouldn't extract in a human or you can't y get from a human it's gotta be manufactured.

 Would you have the same possibilities of um the various medical risks  associated with the .

 The one study which was done in the United Kingdom called the million women study suggested that the uh Livial actually increased the risk of uh breast cancer being diagnosed. Uh however there's a little bit of doubt shown uh or expressed about that million women study because of what we call a cohort study and there are a lot of sort of um problems with its actually sort of uh structure which uh we can't always be sure. We really need to do some uh double blind randomised studies with Livial to see whether it has an adverse effect on breast cancer.

 Would you be happy enough to prescribe Livial to to your patients.

 Oh I do indeed yes I have quite a number of patients on Livial and I have no real problems with its use. But I I must warn people that there is not that nothing's perfect in life and Livial may turn out to be uh as adverse as uh oestrogen is thought to be adverse on breast cancer. But at present I believe it's perfectly okay.

 So for what kind of y'know term therapy could you sort of feel that you could safely prescribe it for like five years ten years.

 At this stage uh again like uh women who um have um hor ordinary hormonal replacement therapy they should take it while ever they feel it is doing them some good with their quality of life. Uh doctors shouldn't be pontificating so you must stop it after five years the  patient must make up their own mind .

 Studies have indicated .

 Alright Judy thanks for the call great to hear from you Lynne uh you you've actually written a paper on this and and you've got a slightly different view.

 Yes um my uh just briefly my own personal history was um  I'm in my mid fifties now but I started going through perimenopause uh at about the age of about thirty-seven-thirty-eight and uh ran into terrible problems unbelievable problems couldn't think straight hot flushes couldn't sleep ye the whole lot and uh the doctor put me on the usual uh Premarin and Provera. Which just made me violently ill even though it did solve the um menopause caused um problems that I was having  so I had to swap to um finally when it was a available I had to swap to the uh skin um absorbed uh oestrogen and progesterone uh and I used a natural oestrogen and a natural progesterone and uh I'll explain the reason for that because most of the problems that women have um with uh things like premenstrual tension endometriosis breast cancer fiboy fibroid tumours of the uterous  et cetera and menstrual flooding are caused by oestrogen dominance. And uh this is where the oestrogen does not balance with the progesterone that we have because a woman is getting too much oestrogen um by an intake of xenoestrogens or foreign oestrogens which the body accepts as oestrogen but they're toxic and they don't act as natural oestrogen and they get these xenoestrogens well they're all  throughout the environment they're in pesticides whence they enter the food chain all petrochemical products  they're in cosmetics detergents cleaning products there's uh a compound called nonylphenyl  as well as um plastics where they're absorbed to any food stored in 'em . So women are getting too much oestrogen and yet when they go on hormonal therapy the first thing the doctor does is give them more oestrogen.

 Barry .

 Well uh that's uh the s hypothesis you're putting forward is the one put out by John Lee . Um John Lee's an interesting man I think it's worth making a comment about him he unfortunately he died last October and I used to have a few arguments with John at various times. John was a ph  pharmacist and back in nineteen-seventy-four he attended a lecture by Ray Peat. Uh at which Ray Peat said it would be a good idea if we could give progesterone um by some means rather than the mouth because progesterone is broken down so rapidly in the gut and the liver. So he suggested that it would be reasonable to give that progesterone as a cream but no one had ever used it then so John Lee as being a pharmacist and then just being a general practitioner in seventy-four went back and developed his own progesterone cream. He then started a company called Avion Pharmaceutical Company uh to produce this progesterone cream and he spent the next uh thirty years of his life uh trying to promote the idea and he wrote most of the um points in little pamphlets about how good it was. When people began to criticise him because it didn't have any real scientific basis he then made up the story which you've just uh told us very nicely and um yeah of course it doesn't hold up because there's no scientific backing for it at all. We've done some of the studies and there's a huge number of uh people have done studies on this particular type of hypothesis of John Lee's. It's just shown to be uh bit of oh rubbish really doesn't hold any kind of water really and I feel sorry that you've been sort of misled by that uh hypothesis of John Lee's but uh it's it's not uh a scientifically valid uh proposition.

 Alright Lynne thank thanks for raising it Edith um uh you wanna talk about alternative uh medication a and self medication.

 Oh that's correct yes I've got three issues to bring up. Um first of all I'm forty-nine years old uh and I'm not obese I'm not a smoker um but I did have um an ovary removed when I was forty-two. Um I was extremely disappointed that the gynaecologist didn't discuss with me how this would affect my menopau uh menopause . Does ovary removal actually bring an early onset of menopause.

 Yes did you have a just one ovary removed  or both.

 Yep.

 I'm sorry.

 One.

 Just  the one.

 Yep.

 The other one that should still I mean it's like removing a kidney um the other ovary will go on functioning until it runs out of its normal uh eggs and that's usually about the normal of um forty-five to fifty-five.

 Yeah.

 Uh have you uh started the menopause as yet.

 Oh yes yeah.

 You have yeah. It it coulda been produced by the um surgery uh obviously I mean you can ha have interference with uh the blood supply to the remaining ovary under these conditions that might have uh faded away a bit earlier that it woulda done under normal conditions. 

 Okay. Well the second issue I wanna bring up is um the issue of alternative therapy it actually does work um because I've refused to go on H R T so I've been experimenting for qu well ever since I've been forty-two  . Um but I have found that of course it's only short term and it may last for three or four months and then y'know you you look at then you have to look at self medicating. And that's another worry for me is is ha I'm on three alternative therapy medications now. Uh I don't know who to turn to to say yes that's too much or no y'know you shouldn't be doing that because I I don't know if there's much research on self medication  but I find it difficult there's no registry to say that there's specialists in menopause that look at both alternative therapies and H R T. But um y'know I don't have that choice and uh I find it difficult how do I ascertain what is what is the a a good level to to maintain alther alternative therapy.

 Well uh there are two parts to it uh that you've explained uh and we've done a lot of work a lotta people have done some research on alternative therapies by the way um. The big thing is that we look at what is natural the previous uh caller um Lynne I think it was talked about natural oestrogen um possibly implying that the pharmaceutical companies don't use natural oestrogen well they do but um you produce from your ovary something called seventeen beta oestradiol . Which is very rapidly uh metabolised to uh something called oestrone which is much weaker than oestradiol  and then eventually it's metaboli that again is metabolised within probably two or three hours to oestriol which is the excretory product. Now um those things are found in every woman's body throughout her normal reproductive life when she goes through the menopause um the levels fall down she stops producing oestradiol but there is still some oestrone being produced and thats being produced by conversion of other products what we call precursors sometimes from the adrenal gland sometimes from other areas into oestrone and that's uh reasonably active uh throughout most women's lives but whether it's enough for your needs depends on so many different factors. Uh for the majority of women going through the menopause it's not enough and they need some top up.

 Mm yeah well it certainly might be in my case uh since the hot flushes I can tolerate but it's the sleep deprivation   that uh causes the problems you you're waking up three-four times a night.

 You you probably need to have your levels of uh oestradiol measured  and as the if there is sufficient oestradiol there it will act on your brain and the pituitary phos uh pituitary gland to um  uh reduce the level of follicular stimulating hormone and I use the level of follicular stimulating hormone and oestradiol as an indication as to whether the patient is getting sufficient oestrogen or not. Um and if you see somebody with some expertise in the area you will probably find that they will measure those and tell you whether you have got sufficient uh oestrogen in there to stop your hot flushes.

 Thanks uh Edith uh Karen you you wanna talk about attitudes to this whole issue.

 Well yes I do I've had I'm one of the alternate people and I've had fantastic results not only through my menopausal time but with other bodily problems through changing my diet 'n' going back to foods that don't come from a factory  and I h um haven't gone onto H R T I don't like the stories I've heard about the suffering of mares in the northern hemisphere to get the necessary oestrogen for H R T. Um.

 Ye you're talking about Premarin there I think.

 Look I don't know um which specific I'm talking about it's the horse stories that bother me so much but I also want to make two strong points it isn't menopause isn't necessarily something to be suffered and also it isn't just a hormonal and bodily change I've found incredible new wisdoms have come to me  about life through my menopausal years so it's not just a hormonal and bodily change it's far broader than that.

 Oh you're quite right I mean  I don't want you to feel that um uh women have to have it or have t h suh h suffer any symptoms. Uh quite a large number of women have no problems whatsoever going through the menopause either  physically or mentally or uh uh emotionally in any way at all but others are affected and we should not e or nobody should say oh because I didn't have any problems then somebody else shouldn't have any either.

 Mm Karen thank you very much for your thoughts uh Ruth um you you want a word about relationship between migraines and the menopause.

 Yes thank you Tony. Um I've been suffering migraines for about twenty years I get about two a month always around the same time  and my doctor keeps telling me that when I go through menopause they'll go away. Um I'm forty-nine I'm just premenopausal I suppose although I'm still getting regular periods. I'm just wondering if I go onto H R T if I need to. What's gunna happen with my migraines.

 Oh that's a very good question and uh thank you for asking it. The big thing to remember is that both men and women get migraines so it's  not just uh to do with hormones . However if hormones are a cause for uh migraine headaches it's usually because there is some triggering either a high level or a low level suddenly occurring . So women who are menstruating  normally of course the levels of hormones go up and down they  fluctuate  throughout the month and it's that fluctuation or rise and fall that so often triggers the migraine  headache . When you go through the menopause if your hormo if your migraines are produced by hormones taking a continual daily dosage should relieve that  particular problem. Or if the levels go right down and you've got no hormones at all present and there's no f triggering their either  they will probably disappear.

 So w w perhaps then it would it even be it may prove helpful to go onto H R T just to for the migraines.

 Oh it it is I mean I have a lot of patients who are in their twenties and thirties that I have treated and relieved I hah I don't cure anything but I relieve their menopausal symptoms and triggers by giving them uh various types of hormonal therapies which will give them no uh uh triggering uh f rise or fall.

 Okay.

 Alright Ruth thanks for the call uh we don't have time for another one uh we did have a a caller ring in saying can trauma bring on an early menopause.

 Uh depends on the trauma if it's a trauma to the pelvis such as involving the uh ovaries or to the pituitary gland uh it may bring on a premature menopause but  uh trauma to the legs or the arm is unlikely to do something like that.

 The book is called Understanding Menopause and Hormonal Therapy A woman's guide Dr Barry Wren is the author and uh it's out and about now through McGraw Hill. Uh Barry thanks very much for joining us tonight. Appreciate it.

 Very great pleasure.

 Good to see you.

 Yes it's a three word title and the first one is African.

 Oh no.

 If you can provide the second two we move on.

 .

 Three words in the title. Formerly banned organisation now the majority party in South Africa's ruling coalition. I share your frustration Greg . I can hear the oohs and ahs from here.

 Well yeah when when he was in prison whe when they were trying to get him out and and y'know they were. This organisation was being given a lot of lot of support.

 That's right.

 I dih.

 Robin Island he was there for twenty-seven years.

 No mate I I lee I let it go but thank thanks very much.

 That's okay Greg. Yeah sometimes it just evades you even though you know it. Kevin from Brisbane hi Kevin.

 Bye-bye.

  Kevin obviously with a slightly American accent I knew he was gunna gunna struggle with that one. Glenys from Hopper's Crossing  g'day h Glenys.

 Hi.

 Hi  um eighteen will you who was the Australian nurse who researched and developed a treatment for infantile paralysis . Sister who.

 Yes it's one of those I know.

 Yes it was uh social studies year four I think that we had her in the in the book.

 Mhm.

 Australian nurse. Developed a treatment for infantile paralysis. Any thoughts about the possibilities.

 Oh.

 You do you have any options that .

 Thinking thinking thinking is it um Elizabeth Kenny.

 Yes it is sister Elizabeth Kenny . Nineteen well done  uh famous women and literature they're your options.

 I think I'll keep on the women.

 Mhm nineteen  uh which famous woman won the Nobel Peace Prize in nineteen-seventy-nine.

 Ah guess I can't ask what for can I .

 Yeah for peace .

 .

 Uh. 

 Um and what year.

 Nineteen-seventy-nine. Who won the Nobel Peace Prize in nineteen-seventy-nine. Haven't been that many women who've won it so it's a very limited subset.

 Was it  ah hang on. Was going to say Marie Curie.

 Mm no she was long dead by then.

 It was a long long time earlier. Tt what.

 Nineteen-seventy-nine Nobel Peace Prize. I thought it was a bit later than that myself but it's a mm. I bow to lash .

 Yes yes always bow to lash and and I'm bowing to brains trust that's not working.

 Oh damn. Well um  a prominent woman that might have won the Novel Peace Prize.

 In nineteen.

 Seventy-nine.

 Seventy-nine I'm just frantically  what can I waffle on about to give me time  I can't. Um  dah dah dah I'm gunna hear that horrible .

 Yeah I I can't.

  Burmese.

 Sorry.

 She wasn't Burmese.

 I can't tell you that.

 Oh okay mm well I suppose I  . Was it .

 Have a guess it's worth a guess. 

  Uh Golda Meir.

 Oh not Golda Meir but thank you for trying uh June from Hobart hi June.

 I haven't got a clue either and it's my first time on.

 Ooh I'd love to be giving you a clue  but at nineteen I think they will they'd be tearing me limb from limb  Uh.

 I've been trying for months to get on.

 Oh I'm sorry . Well it's not Golda Meir but I I mean there haven't been that many who've even been a possibility I mean there there's been a handful of women who've won this.

 Yes that's what I w I was thinking of her as well. I ca  I can't think of anybody else.

 Oh I can think of one .

 Oh gee.

 It's the peace prize angle that is the.

 Oh peace prize now who.

 Somebody who was out there.

 She wasn't Indian by any chance was she.

 Not Indian no.

 Ah .

 Who were you thinking of.

 Oh was it um what's her name Nehru's daughter. What's her name.

 Oh yes Mrs Gandhi.

 Gandhi yes  mhm.

 Yes no no no.

 No.

 That's uh strangely it it June  you're   you're you're targ  you're  you're you're targeting the area quite well June but uh you  you went the wrong way I think.

 No I can't think of anybody else .

 Oh damn I'm sorry. Not to be Betty Betty from Mornington might be the answer here.

 Ah Tony I'm I'm pretty sure it's the lady from Burma but I just can't think of her name.

 Tt damn and blast.

 Sorry.

 Sorry about that. Tt Jeremiah 

 . 

 G'day mate how are you . Na nineteen it is.

 I I I'm wondering whether it's you talk about the area whether it's  the uh Burmese woman or Mrs Gandhi but I wuh wuh I think it's um  oh the I don't know if she's old enough but I think she's the uh the woman from the woman who's from Burma. Her name was An An Win Wa .

 A Aung San Suu Kyi.

 Yeah.

 Yeah no nice guess not correct uh Michael from the Blue Mountains g'day Michael.

 How are you Tony.

 Yeah seventy-nine would make it uh too early for Aung San Suu Kyi.

  before I bomb out I think I'll say hello again to darling Glenda and why is she still awake at this hour of the night . Um was it Mother Teresa.

 Yes.

 Ah.

 Was Mother Teresa of Calcutta who of course uh was originally from uh  Yugoslavia wasn't she I think she was born in either Yugoslavia or Albania or something like that. Anyway um yeah right  June was in the right section of the world but the wrong area of uh of interest. Question twenty famous women we have one uh literature we have five.

  mm yes.

 Strangely it doesn't really matter because uh the famous women is in area of literature.

 Oh really. Yeah don't lose hope those still waiting on.

 Mm .

 Uh  oh well well okay let's finish off the famous women.

 Okay the question is who wrote The Good Earth. Very famous book I did that at school.

 I have absolutely no idea.

 You obviously didn't go in to my school .

 Was it Enid Blyton.

 Oh thanks thanks very much Michael appreciate that. Ken from Mt Pleasant.

 How are you Tony.

 Not bad mate.

 Uh before I go on just say hello to John and June and also to uh uh John and Amy.

 Yeah.

 Oh good .

 This one's a a a bit testing twenty-one. I can only just I can remember the book but I I c  don't think I could remember the author. You may do better. Twenty-one which American novelist wrote Tobacco Road. My grandma had a copy of it it was  very dog eared. Which American novelist wrote Tobacco Road.

 Um look I'm sure it's wrong but I'll just suggest John Steinbeck.

 Mm no it's not Steinbeck sorry uh Lesley from Glenmore Park.

 Oh hello Tony you don't sound at all well tonight.

 I look I'm not unwell I just sound unwell um it's it's it's one of those things uh I have um I've been s sort of taking the tablets and soldiering on but  um it's uh uh partly self inflicted I think I had a I had a late last night which sorta didn't help my uh my condition as they say.

 Pay the consequences .

 Oh absolutely but uh I I've this brewing for since probably buh I think people started to detect it on Thursday I was sort of a bit sniffly and then Friday it was mm and uh so I've probably got about least another two days of this uh but it hopefully it'll starts to lift.

 Yeah well I hope your voice stays .

 Yeah no I uh I was bit rough uh the the first few words this morning were a little bit vuhvuhruh  but it's got a bit better since then. Uh an American novelist I've gotta say I I couldn't remember this if if you paid me but um the American novelist who wrote Tobacco Road I'll give you a help the initials are E C.

 E C.

 It's a hard question.

 The only thing I remember of Tobacco Road is the song .

 Yeah no the  Nashville Teens I think had the had the hit . Oh but y'know mm I don't blame you  um Ron from Orange hi Ron.

 G'day Tony how are you mate.

 Good mate any thoughts about Tobacco Road the author.

 Uh just before I have a go at that  I'm not quite sure uh I'd care to dispute an answer given late last week um the last um question on the quiz about horses. The question was what strap holds a pack saddle onto a horse  and the   said surcingle and you agreed and I'd bet big money it's a girth.

 Yeah well look I I I genuinely Ron I c I couldn't argue with you I mean if you if you say it's a girth it uh it possibly is but I I um.

 Surcingle a surcingle is the outer strap and it's more or less a safety strap in case the girth gives.

 Yeah I I'm noh look. I'm not an expert in that area I I d I don't know horses uh at all so um  y'know I I'll bow to your experience I I'm just I I I I can only go on what sh what uh madam lash gives me  and sh that's what she had and um so if it uh I don't think we  uh did anybody any damage through it though but um if we did sorry. Uh well the American novelist uh who wrote Tobacco Road.

 I really can't answer I was thinking F Scott Fitzgerald till you said E C.

 E C no no no not F Scott uh can't do any business there Sue from Concord.

 Hello there Tony.

 Hello amer American novelist Tobacco Road. 

 Well I was thinking might be Erskine Caldwell.

 It was. Erskine Caldwell. Well done twenty-two.

 I think I'll choose literature.

 Good move  what is the name of the horse given to Gandalf by King Theoden in Tolkien's Lord of the Rings.

 Oh  well I can ask my brains trust what is the name of the horse given to Gandalf  in.

 By King Theoden in  in.

 By King Theoden in Lord of the Rings.

 Yep.

 Before we answer that.

 Uh before we answer that can we say  girths and the ssurserng  are the  hang on my horsey person brains trust will tell you but can I just say hello to Peewee P T chal  Chalice and the Burwood Drummoyne Family History Group .

 Grief.

  Yes.

 It's getting longer and longer.

 Hello.

 Hello.

 I used to put saddles on horses when I was  a child  and the girth is the strap that goes it's attached on one side to the saddle and goes underneath and  is attached on the other side to the saddle so it holds the saddle on and a surcingle goes completely around the horse and goes through a slot in the saddle on one side over the top of the saddle and down through another slot in the saddle so both a girth and a surcingle are the correct answers and I think surcingle  as it was worded in the question I think surcingle was the correct .

 Yeah no I I thi I think it was worded specifically so that it indicated that it uh it held a number of things in place so  yeah so.

 Girth is actually attached to the saddle the surcingle is a separate strap but it goes through slots in the saddle to hold the saddle on . And I think we're not gunna get anywhere with The Lord of the Rings and uh I think we pass it on to to others.

 Good on you Mary thanks for that uh Gerrard from Geelong.

 Evening Tony.

 Evening mate uh the na .

 That was a little discussion.

 Yes indeed mate you're a horse fan this this shouldn't be a problem.

 I was astounded today by the comment of a good friend who said that she hates getting the train to work now. Because she fears trains could be a terrorist target. I guess what shocked me was that someone who I've always considered being intelligent and of sound judgement is now scared to perform a simple everyday task like commuting to work. Tt makes you wonder to what extent we're all frightened and that we might be at the centre of the next terrorist attack. Obviously the latest bombings in Madrid have focused us on the on the potential  for such a horrific thing to occur in our own back yard  and news reports say that uh a video tape received by the Spanish government claimed that the Al Qaeda terrorist network was responsible for the bombings which last week killed two hundred and injured many many more. The attack was reportedly a payback for Spain's cooperation with the United States over Iraq. So where does that leave us so I guess even the Australian Federal Police commissioner Mick Kelty uh appears to have contradicted a key government message by claiming  Australia's decision to commit troops to Iraq has possibly increased the risk of Australia becoming a terrorist target. Now that does make me feel a little nervous but prime minister Howard is sticking to the key message saying there's no direct link between the Madrid bombings and Australia. He says all western countries are in fact potential terrorist targets. Australia is now in the process of analysing its own antiterrorist laws but can any amount of police protection guarantee the safety of a nation's citizen. I think not uh even Mr Howard acknowledges  that life must go on and that governments are limited in what they can do. He says the idea that you can guard every movement of every person on every railway station in every part of Australia is lunatic. It's unrealistic. So w  how safe do you feel. I mean is your life affected by the threat of terrorism. It's our issue tonight the threat of terrorism here on our shores like to have your thoughts.



 The next issue is how far do we go to try and ensure our safety. Should our authorities be given broader powers. Something that New South Wales is certainly having a look at uh the Herald is reporting tomorrow  that uh the security laws that have been put in place already will be reviewed to see if they need to be toughened. Because uh  the meeting that took place in Sydney indicated that um Sydney could be a major target. Tt following the attacks in Madrid prime minister Howard ordered a national meeting of transport security chiefs. That was uh that's coincided with the start of this five day annual security conference in Sydney in which the police chiefs from all the states 'n' t all the territories along with uh some of their counterparts from Asia will look at how Australia and its near neighbours can actually better counter this terrorism threat. New South Wales premier Bob Carr delivered the keynote speech and presented his five point plan on counterterrorism. It includes uh a major review of all New South Wales offences which could be linked to a terrorist act or threat  sharing information between state and federal governments and agencies  and the concept of setting up a ministry for homeland security. I guess similar to the American model. Er the federal opposition leader Mark Latham is also calling for a one stop shop. Saying what's needed here is an integrated coordinated approach to protect commuter transport networks. Police and security experts are also pushing for an overhaul of of Commonwealth counterterrorism laws which they claim harm their ability to find and charge terrorists. New South Wales police commissioner Ken Moroney is saying that the primary police  concerns uh are lifting restrictions on how long terror suspects could be detained. And being permitted to use material gathered with listening devices as evidence in court. Currently most listening device warrants issued for terror investigation can only be issued for intelligence gathering purposes  not in courts. Also on the commissioner's agenda are moves for police to take greater control of the area around scenes of terror attacks and to use security guards as a as a quasi counterterrorist spy network. Now this follows the news that the federal government plans to introduce a new offense of consorting with terrorists. The laws would be loosely based on some state laws which jail people who associate with criminals.



 Tt civil libertarians have slammed the proposal they're warning innocent people are gunna get dragged into police investigations which will interfere with freedom of association. Do you have any concerns  how far should we go in our efforts to protect our country our citizens our transport systems. Our issue tonight is about the threat of terrorism here in Australia. Like to hear your comments. Some interesting uh material in in uh what the papers were saying. Uh they're suggesting that the F B I has clearly stated that Australia is a terror target. I know it's not something the prime minister wants to hear but uh the F B I is saying yes it is  Sydney could be one city um but it could be Canberra it could be Melbourne. I suppose um the instant reaction to the Spanish  bombings where we saw a government thrown out over the weekend because of its poor response to terrorism  has sent a an extra chill through some western governments. You uh saw the conservative government that had been closely associated with  George W Bush uh a strong supporter of Tony Blair um basically chucked out of office. And uh the socialist government that has come in in Spain is saying we are pulling our troops out of Iraq by June if there isn't a U N mandate in place if there's not U N  control of what's happening in Iraq. So um y'know as much as we say y'know the the thing that we want to avoid is having the terrorist attacks influence us uh I suh I suppose in Spain it's had a very direct influence a change of government.



 G'day Robin.

 Oh.

 You're saying that uh multiculturalism uh as far as you're concerned is actually hindering the the efforts to uh to deal with terrorism.

 Oh I think so I I think that uh we were uh I I only say that twenty-five years ago I thought it was one of the most foolish policies we embarked on without  a procker proper consultation with the Australian people. That one of the upshots of it is the fact that if you've got four-hundred-thousand Muslims in Australia which we now have according to the Australian  um it makes the the job diabolically difficult uh because the nature of terrorism is it hides amongst  people uh causes great difficulties and great rifts within the population and really that's what I had to say that uh we were going to be a terrorist target anyway.

 Yeah but I mean we don't wanna start uh y'know uh just painting Muslims as as as as a a an enemy from within I mean there're there're plenty of uh Muslims who detest terrorism to the back teeth  and yes there are some extremists in the in the community both worldwide and here  but uh y'know they're very much in the minority.

 Yes but that's exactly what I'm saying. I'm not saying that the majority of Muslims are terrorists or even even uh identify with terrorism what I'm saying is that the fight against terrorism since its Islamic terrorism is just made ih virtually impossible now with the very large number of Muslims in Australia it's not possible to identify who's a terrorist and who's not because it's so difficult to get an entree w into a community which is in fact quite separate from mainstream Australia . I'm just saying it's much much more difficult.

 Okay well well ih ih how are we gunna deal with that if that's uh if that is the case and it's something we obviously can't reverse.

 You can't deal with it. That's what I said twenty-five years ago. The policy of multiculturalism is irreversible. If you make a mistake you can't undo  twenty-five years of immigration. Um you just can't do it . I was talking to Jewish friend the other day and I said how's all this affecting you and he said look  we have prayers  at um at the synagogue where you always kept the door open. Now we have to notify the rabbi um h whether we're coming or not because they close the door and they have to know how many people are in there. Uh I mean this is affecting the whole of our life and uh.

 It is very disturbing I I I understand that and um I don't know whether we'll ever feel as secure as we have in the past. I think I think the the future is going to be more difficult to deal with.

 Oh well we've got to be very tough there's no doubt about that.

 Mm well we we we're in a situation also where there seems to be a new strand of terrorism with these explosions in Madrid. Uh there was no suicide bombers involved with this this was uh just y'know gear that was placed in y'know prominent positions on public transport and exploded.

 Yes it's like the AIDS virus it can replicate itself in whole range of variables and as you say we're never going to get rid of it but if we are tough and we elect the right leaders and we have a f firm determination to be fair to everyone but also to be very tough with our own freedoms and we're gunna have to make those sacrifices  we can certainly beat it in the end but it's going to be a m a m as you say a very massive job.

 Thanks very much Robin Wayne you you're saying uh does John Howard think the earth is flat as well.

 Yeah well after uh his comments on radio tonight and on um seven-thirty report wuh I think he must.

 Mm.

 It's unbelievable wuh anyway uh you started off your commentary abou um do you feel um uh scared or anything like that and would you  um wuh I I don't particularly feel scared where I am and I guess you know where I am.

 Mm.

 Um but um.

 Well it's close to the national capital.

 Yes that's right but um I think I'd be um a bit worried if I was travelling around Sydney on um public public transport 'n' stuff  .Um.

 I think I think  I think the scary thought is that y'know it doesn't require the uh the suicide bombers that uh September eleven required  uh y'know these've essentially y'know they they've just got technology that allows them to uh y'know detonate these things remotely.

 That's right yeah um by like you can do 'em with your phone y'know your  mobile phone or anything or it be ve um which  makes it very scary . But um yes.

  I mean is there any answer to it I mean ih can you defend yourself against something.

 I don't think so no I um you can beef up beef up all the uh security as as much as you like and I don't think you'll be able to stop it.

 Mm.

 Yeah so but anyway I'll leave  with that.

 Thanks very much   uh Sue you you believe there is a greater threat.

 Well I think there is look I've lived in the U K for two and a half years Tony  and uh at one stage there was a bomb that went off in London Bridge. And luckily I didn't know about it at the time my ex husband was going up towards London Bridge and his train got diverted off sideways. But I figure that your time is up whenever your time is up and now it doesn't matter which government has been in power in the U K the I R A's been operating there for ever s ever so long and they can't s uh stop it's only  in the last few years but the other thing is Howard's in a bit of a bind. If we n not that before we went in to Iraq and Afghanistan there wasn't any of these special security increase legislation  for t antiterrorism and things like that. It's only since and we've all all of a sudden  these big t antiterrorist conferences it's since going into Iraq so one can only conclude  that it is because of going in and p being a part of the coalition of the willing and the other thing  is that at least now Howard his credibility has been peeled back a bit as Glen Milne said in The Australian. Peeled back a bit and you can't just rely on oh national security national security because  he's not he's n b he's there is no way that he can protect every everyone it's gunna happen it's gunn happen and  and I think  equal.

 I'd better leave it there Sue I we're about to hit the news but more comments after the news this is the NightLife.



 Yeah it's uh very disturbing indeed there are a lot of issues to deal with uh ih this question and uh it all seems to  um surround the uh police powers. Uh the the the future of um exactly how we try and deal with terrorism in Australia  and exactly what sort of changes we need to make to our lifestyle and to ensure that uh everything's gunna be okay or is it possible to ch make those sort of changes perhaps we're gunna be uh caught no matter what happens. Jill uh y you believe we need to stand firm in this whole thing.

 Y yeah yeah same Tony um I think y'know Australia ih is y'know sort of joined the rest of the world in in uh  in the wake of these terrorist threats I mean I I think our era of splendid isolation is well and truly over. Um when I say stand firm I I think uh uh what I mean is we need to stand firm in being fair to people. In um oh it's an old fashioned term but in doing good I suppose  of y'know keeping faith and hope and not becoming um terrorised. I mean I must admit when I heard about the bombings in Madrid I work my workplace is opposite a railway station I thought oh that's no good . And I remember when I was in London in ninety-six and I was really shocked y'know I wasn't prepared for  um y'know no rubbish bins all the messages on the trains saying don't leave packages unattended and it really did make me feel uneasy for a while . But I.

 It's very necessary isn't it when you w when you see things like this happening in Madrid.

 Well I don't know I don't know how far you go y'know I really don't know how far you go. I still think y'know the chance of being in a being killed in a car accident is much higher isn't it.

 Oh absolutely. And in fact uh I th I think that's something that most officials say uh that y'know if it really changes our lives they've won. Simply because  uh y'know they y'know they've ac got the ability to to to make change and to drive change by the terrorist actions . And yes the chance of us um being killed individually as uh y'know a percentage in uh y'know o ad id ih everyday chance it's it's quite  you've probably bigger chance of being crushed by an elephant but   y'know I mean uh uh y'know the last thing we want is uh y'know a Bali bombing happening even closer to home.

 Yeah and I think our uh our part in the w what are we called the coalition of something or other .

 Coalition of the willing.

 The willing  that's right. I think that has made us um more of a target. And I think the Spanish government was thrown out because of that but also because they lied about it y'know they tried to blame ETA immediately. Trying to deflect y'know responsibility. Um I I just think if we keep on this spiral of um attacking people all the time and um y'know looking to protect ourselves in militaristic sorts of ways ih it can only get worse  I really think we have to  as I said just stand firm and and continue to be fair to people.

 A lotta the experts say we really have no alternatives but to support the Americans um but I guess how far we do is  is a big question.

 Mm it's like well it's not we had no alternative but to go and fight in the Boer War and to go to Gallipoli y'know.

 The Maori wars . It ju it goes way back I mean.

 We do we do have choices y'know but I think fear often uh rules those choices for us.

 Yeah thanks Jill great to hear from you. Um it is true um but a lotta people saying well you have to be in an alliance it's uh you can't stand free of it and we are firmly wedged with the Americans the British and the Europeans although a lot of the Europeans seem to have broken loose of recent times. We welcome back West Australian listeners after the mid evening bulletin uh this is the NightLife and the issue of the day and tonight we're looking at uh terrorism and how it's likely to impact on everyday Australian life. Um some far reaching police powers to search arrest and detain people suspected of planning or committing terrorist acts are set to be strengthened in certain states and uh it is a very different atmosphere post Madrid. Peter um you're you're worried about our security.

 Well I'm concerned about I go to Spain fairly regularly and uh I've been reading the Spanish newspapers a couple of points I'd like to raise because  there seems to be a a breakdown in the Spanish intelligence services which is very bad. And uh there was no warning  that this was going to happen and uh it's amazing because the uh Spanish have a very very large police force as you probably know.

 Mm.

 And uh a very active intelligence system because Morocco is so close to them. Now a Al Qaeda assuming it was Al Qaeda  was able to outwit them and uh there's some funny business somewhere because it took them a very long time to get to that cell phone. In fact uh it took them quite a while and uh  then .

 I notice of the five suspects arrested three are Moroccans.

 Yeah but there was a long interval and they should have got to that to the source of that uh cell phone the sim card a lot quicker than they did. The Spanish people were protesting against Aznar because he had lied to them. And they didn't like that and they also were protesting because the intelligence services had failed and I would think that uh the question of lies uh might take us back to children overboard. And there might be a lesson there somewhere for this government.

 Mm  uh do do you think that Australia is in the firing line there is the potential for a a Madrid in Australia.

 Oh I think there's no doubt about that uh uh I read extensively and I follow everything on the internet and  I've never uh in the nine years or so that I've been on the internet m I've never seen Australia mentioned so often. And uh it's a bit spooky to to find yourself uh linked uh with this coalition. But um I mean that's life we've been taken there and um uh we have to live with it and I just hope and I have great faith in uh in uh Keelty the commissioner. I think he is a good man I think he's a very honest man and I think he's extremely bright. And he gives me a great deal of confidence therefore I shall um travel in uh public transport quite normally I'm not gunna be spooked by any of this but I think that uh the government may have led us into a very dangerous situation.

 Peter thanks for your thoughts Rick uh y you think the prime minister's talking up terror all the time.

 Yes I think um there's just been a a bit of a shift I've noticed in the last couple of days with Mr Howard um originally talking up the terrorist angle and using it I think in the same way as your previous caller talked about with the children overboard situation where it's a wedge politics to make people feel a sense of fear whether it's true or not. We all know now that it's true and as soon as this uh evidence comes back that it is true with things like the bombing in Madrid he seems to um take another tact and try and remove himself from having um any responsibility involved with um bringing Australia into this situation. I just think that your first caller originally when you first started this segment before the news spoke about multiculturalism and said that he felt it was a problem I think it's actually the key. I think an open hearts and open minds sort of attitude with an alternative to conflict and tension and the attention that can be gained through this sort of action needs to be defused I mean ten years ago this country was sort of put up on a pedestal was a model for the rest of the world in how well multiculturalism was working here  and in freedom of religion in freedom of speech and freedom of belief and and I just don't know where we're going. I think ten years ago we were on the right track and we had good relationships with our um neighbours in Asia and around the general region and I just think this move away to the right has been extremely damaging but I'm hoping that it's the last swing to the right that we get for some time because these things always seem to have a pendulum affect and I think we're swinging back the other way now and I think it's high time and I just hope that we haven't done too much damage that is irreversible.

 Thanks Rick great to hear from you um Jean Pierre you want a word about this as well you you believe we need to look at  why there is terrorism.

 Yes I mean like leh let's face it you can put uh uh whatever change whatever law you want up to this or that but I don't think it's gunna  uh influence a decision of somebody who's gunna decide to blow a bridge or anything like that . Um the the major part I took offence to the chap just before the news uh who seemed to blame the Muslim. And he he made a reference to his Jewish friend who has to close the door. Um we were all screaming our head off um uh in February last year or sometime last year because um Iraq had the twelve years to uh or ten years to  obey U N resolution but every for body seemed to forget that since nineteen-sixty-seven Israel has forgotten to um uh imply the uh is uh the United Nation resolution they must pull out of the West Bank and Palestine. And basically the whole Al Qaeda movement was based for that. If you take Bin Laden if you sort of study um his early beginning and all his whole life  he he only had two reasons for being it. First it was to overthrow the government in Saudi Arabia which is rotten and corrupt . Two to um prevent um Israel from destroying Palestine and therefore he was an eme enemy of the American. Right. Now if you don't need the problem pretty soon we will create a rift between the Christian and the Muslim which eventually uh the the Muslim country have a lesser living of standard than the western world and it's very easy for anybody who takes over down there to use the western world as a c scapegoat.

 Yes.

 You see what I mean by that and no law that you're gunna put no phone tapping no um. I mean if we go in phones they got a pirate solution they got this they got that they got tha it still happens.

 It is impossible to defend against somebody who's prepared to die for a cause.

 That's right and when you think about the intelligence from the America I mean American spent as as b I think the C I A on its own has a bih a forty billion budget but yet. Wha wha what what did they knew about Spain. Absolutely nothing . Right and uh we just can't cope to keep on saying we need America we need America we need America  I can't stuh uh uh stick  hang on America need us too you know. What about pine uh Pine Gap. Where they gunna put that  I mean that's a big part of their uh o of their anti espionage thing. What about the um the big um radar in uh near Canberra with the needs for the NASA and things like that . Y'know so ih it's not just saying y'know but we need America we need. We need to stand on our own two bloody two feet for a change you know sort of said where  you know sorry but you know this is not legal this is not moral this is uh the problem is a problem for the Middle East it was created  um with the Balfour resolution during the First World War. Uh it's it then it turn into lies after lies after lies until eventually um England uh wash uh their hand with uh with uh the Palestine solution and give it to the United Nation . Y'know and ih .

 Yeah uh ih it's a lot more complex than a lotta people are suspecting and uh and ye you're right y you p really have to look at the reasons for the terrorism uh ih as potentially I guess the the the main solution. Jean Pierre thanks for y for your thoughts on it. Magpie uh consistency is your issue.

 Don't you like what I put up on the board.

 Consistency.

  Well probably a few listeners wouldn't mind if a few black and white feathers flew but I don't think Bingar is a major target. Um H M A S Success in New Zealand . Feel very sorry for the crew because I have a feeling that there's some uh uh readjustments going on in uh routines over there. But that is just how simple this sort of thing can happen . Um even if they did write the right thing on the side of it. At first I don't think we have enough information exactly at this moment to to acknowledge who is behind it there may be some educated guesses.

 Well the European and Arab intelligence officials say the preliminary investigation and uh the interrogation of the five arrested  is really pointing heavily towards Al Qaeda.

 Only one of whom apparently is uh of interest the others were uh uh phone shop owners. Um I mean the for ooh I don't know there was a great organisation went on behind this incident uh the timing the the whole thing that was needed uh listening to someone there you needed to organise the uh coordinate have vehicles have  have h safe houses have escape routes so there was more than one involved uh it was a big organisation of some by some very clever person. Um we have been warned uh time and time again n Australia has been named um by this coalition of the willing is the alliance between the warnings and our vulnerability. Um but you see no weapons of mass destruction Tony have actually been found in Iraq which mea could be inferred that Iraq was actually complying with that U N resolution which the U S and its puppets used as an excuse to go into Iraq. So in actual fact ih it almost makes it an illegal act in itself uh after the event.

 Mm  well the the French and the Germans certainly thought that.

 Well precisely um  now  Mr Howard today said it wasn't neccessary to upgrade a warning colour but several uni uni European countries have gone from yellow to orange and one's gone to red . And.

 I think we were listed as being at medium level at this time.

 Well when Mr Howard was asked he said no it was not neccessary change. Alright everybody who have a fridge magnet what is the national security hotline number Tony . It's a good trivia question 'cos no one remembers it.

 Dear oh dear . You ask you do ask the tough questions. Thanks Magpie Warren uh ye you um an L P G tanker driver.

 Yes mate.

 And you've had some directives from your company.

 Yes I've been um we've been instructed by the company in writing as well as verbally um to be aware of what's around us we do a lotta late night deliveries.

 Yes.

 And we've been told be very careful. If we don't think it's safe to drive off. Um one of our drivers says what happens if we get confronted by people in vehicles and he won't let you drive over 'em if you have to. This is um  .

 That's interesting.

 Yeah.

 A a and and what they're they're they're concerned that there is the possibility of  somebody trying to commandeer a vehicle and and do damage with it.

 Yeah well y'know like a forty-five-thousand litre L P G tank would make a helluva big hole in the ground.

 It would.

 And and um  we've been told be very careful and if we don't think it's safe to keep driving then call the authorities. Um I'm  out at the mo I'm out at the moment working. And w y'know w w w we go to some s pretty dark and horrible places in the middle of the night. And um y'know we're we're all concerned and  even our families are concerned 'cos y'know we we've gone back to our families and said been told to do this and um . Yeah.

 That is really scary.

 Yeah well it it would make a helluva mess I can tell you now  it'd make a helluva mess.

 Yeah that's reason to be concerned.

 'Cos um 'cos um L P G is very very volatile even more than y'know your average unleaded fuel so uh it's . Yeah it's a bit worrying 'n' you you might say when you're driving the thing around all day.

 Absolutely Warren thanks for passing that on that's uh that's interesting  a new approach from a company when uh  when dealing with uh anybody who might approach an L P G tanker. Colin uh you you believe if we surrender to terror they're the winners.

 Oh of course uh you just have to have a look what's happening in Spain now . Uh the terrorist there now know that they can.

 Change governments.

 Government . And change government policy. And how can you do it you can do it through bombs . Um and that means they are now in the driving seat they are going to win this uh campaign. If the rest of us give up if the rest of us give in to them and I guess it's called a form of appeasement . Um I I find that very concerning and uh.

 It is a very difficult task this this uh declared war on terror from president George W Bush. Uh it's simply because it's such an amorphous mass . Uh it's h it's hard to know exactly where they are. Where they they thought that they knew where most of the training bases were in Afghanistan . Um I don't know whether they control much more than the Afghani capital. Uh and a and a small area around that.

 Well the Northern Alliance scar has a large slice of northern Afghanistan and that's nominally within the control of the alliance . Of of the sorry the coalition of the willing. Um uh y'know we shouldn't underestimate what has been achieved in Afghanistan certainly the  dreaded uh Taliban have gone.

 Oh  no no question that uh it was good to to have them departed but  uh y you you sort of wonder whether the American focus uh moved to Iraq and uh y'know basically let Afghanistan go.

 Oh true there there there's uh evidence in that I guess. Uh the point I would make though that we as a nation ha have been marked already. We were marked  at the time of our events in Afghanistan  um.

 We were also marked uh at East Timor.

 East Timor that's right and I would suggest that we were marked before that because  these people the terrorists they don't like who we are or what we stand for. And if we start surrendering and giving in to their  dictates their demands well they win and the world will be poorer for it.

 Thanks Colin great to hear from you uh Eve you uh you believe we've been at war with terror for uh a long time.

 Uh uh yes uh Tony I just heard you say before  well there's probably a reason for terrorism. There's no such a reason for terrorism it's a most insidious horrible thing. Now uh uh uh what that foreman meh Colin said uh uh that the new socialist government is going to appease these terrorists so that any time in the future uh any country's going to have an election they'll boh blow up a few uh trains and dictate who's going to govern the country . So all your listeners who who  y'know it's always they get on to have this shot at John Howard anyway  uh th they will come on and say oh what wuh y'know we've got wuh t terrorism ih you blame the Americans you blame  the English and you bla blame the Australians uh uh can you remeh you wouldn't remember sixty years ago when Hitler tried to take over the world. And and Japan and our allies went and fought them otherwise Hitler wuh wuh would've taken over the whole world. You you don't give in to them Tony . Now uh I I I really can't believe all these people that are blaming the coalition uh for for going to war with Iraq and and these other countries these fundamentalist Islamic terrorist  and y'know I I will justify which uh uh we're all required to to say not all Muslims are terrorists  but there's a lot of them who hate Christians. Uh the ye y'know all you people who come on and defend these people uh that uh you're getting the message aren't you that they hate Christians and we are at war with them.

 Mm well I I think there's a war on terrorism I don't think there's a war against m uh uh Islam. Uh it's uh it it it is a a y'know a conflict that  uh is based on uh Osama Bin Laden and his uh connections that uh are determined to  y'know make radical changes in  the Middle East and America.

 They're promising they're going to take over the world and kill the infidels is that correct. That's a war isn't it . So what do you do. Do you just sit back and let them take over the world.

 Yes I I think that uh y'know th they can disrupt the world I don't think they can take over the world it's not it's not like they've got an army like uh Adolf Hitler had behind him and y'know the he had the potential to take over the world. And I think y'know this is a group that can rock the world certainly but not uh not not uh uh y'know dem uh commandeer us.

 Any anyway Tony I I'm I'm just  uh fearful of the people that we now have in Australia  who've just uh wih wih with their provincial political thinking blame everything on John Howard I think he's a very brave man. Uh who has taken on these terrorists like two-hundred Australians uh uh were blown up three-thousand Americans were blown up uh two hundred uh uh Spanish people were blown up the other day so what do we do. Do we appease them or do we go to war against terrorism . I think that's the main question people should be asking.

 Thanks very much for your point of view uh Dawn you you believe the prime minister's correct.

 Yes I do and I'm so pleased to hear Colin and Eve thinking correctly. I n I know for one that I don't want to have to walk down the street wheeling my grandchild thinking can't I take him in there or can't I take him there. I wanna enjoy his time with me while I'm alive  and I and my grandchildren to come and as as far as defending Australia I think people are are it amazed me I they're the  the islalelu  the Islamic race is winning. Uh they they have already won it is a war terrorism is a war and they're they're already winning they do have the means  you say they can't take over the world.

 Well I mean th they doh they don't have the means to to y'know dominate the world at this time.

 Well sneaking into places and bombing bombing innocent people  blowing hundreds of people up at a time I mean  that's good odds isn't it.

 Yeah well it certainly rocks the world there is no question of it and I mean everybody is firmly focussed on what happened in Spain I mean uh ih it was terrible I mean these people were uh poor workers they were uh y'know um uh students they were every everyday average people who were  who were killed by this uh  terrorist outrage.

 Can you think of a place in Australia where they couldn't get to. You could you think of place in Australia that's safe. And what if they were so well organised that they could choo asy as a caller previously said uh they could use telephones to ignite these bombs from long distances away. I mean they could do twenty thirty places at a time . It must have taken a lot of organisation for those people to get the planes to work in places where they could be trusted y'know in America and then all of a sudden that great disaster I mean there were thousands killed there. And those people were going into people's homes as friends . I I can't believe that people can be so naive  as n as I mean I look at it almost as treason when you go against your own country and I think John Howard is a is a very brave man and I think we've got the right man at the helm he  nothing rocks him where he can think he can think evenly about things every every problem that's thrown at him in this situation he's very s he's a steadfast person he stands stands there  and protects our country and and makes decisions that that affect us every day that keep us safe. Uh I I think people are are choosing a game of dice they're throwing it in the air and saying yes we'll choose this it's like barracking for a football team. They get a they get an idea into their head and they think oh yeah this is good this'll be good but not one of those people would be willing to say  I bet you if he said come on stand up with me and protect our country they wouldn't. I have a son who's just come out of the army he's now in the police force and he was overseas. And I I dread to think I have another son as well that they would stand up there and protect people like these. And what would they do what would they have done if they had've if there had've been and I still believe there were weapons somewhere I believe that he had a l it's a huge place over there and he had a lotta countries  as allies to put those weapons long long ago uh otherwise why wouldn't he let them come in straight away and look.

 Alright Dawn thanks for that uh good to hear from you James you you believe that fear is taking over uh.

  g'day mate um good conversation tonight. Yeah I was in England got back just over a year ago  on a working holiday visiting relatives. Caught the tube from Padding to Waterloo 'n'  mate I hated it  it was awful . And it wasn't me and and um one thing I learned and my family and friends told me is that  people weren't very friendly and people don't say hello and I just hate the idea that 'cos I grew up in Sydney. I just hate the idea that it's gunna become like that 'cos I remember Sydney as a happy friendly city and  people say g'day y'know just  just and then they're achieving what they want to achieve just just by that and I just hope that it doesn't become that way because I thought it was awful. And I found myself becoming that way. I'd see a bag a bag or baggage on the train and no one near it. Y'know.

 You'd move away.

 And I'd go uhp  no I wouldn't I'd go who's that belong to .

 Oh okay.

 Where's that come from  and I'd I'd watch it. And and all the warnings and the and the alerts over the over the network and and the voice overs and things and it does get to you and I just  hate to think that.

 I mean ih ih terrorism isn't brand new here either I mean we y you only have to think back to uh what was it nineteen-seventy-eight the CHOGM conference at the Hilton hotel in Sydney. The  the bomb that went off outside of the Hilton . Um so it's it's and y'know we've we've had an explosion at uh the police  headquarters in in Adelaide we've had uh  the uh y'know and and Bali o obviously even though it wasn't  on Australian territory it was almost de facto Australian territory.

 It was yeah yeah. I I just I just don't like the the idea that that we might become very unfriendly people and suspicious and a bit paranoid about  where we go and what we do and I just hope it doesn't become that way 'cos that's what I experienced in England and I didn't like it at all basically .

 Yeah I know I I understand exactly what you're saying James thanks uh Steve you you're concerned about the increased powers issue you have a bit of a problem with uh unlimited powers.

 Yes very much so actually soon I'll be more scared of uh uh t uh the police than the terrorists . Because um if they suddenly have powers holding you without arrest and all of that it um  takes off uh the pressure on the police to actually uh be a bit more um thorough in their investigation. They can just hold you because oh you look like a terrorist and suddenly um you could be in their custody for a period of time which can affect uh your family life  once I find that you are in custody you uh tend to um uh you you feel that you're powerless and uh with uh with them being able to say well you can come here and uh we don't ha even have to charge you with anything.

 Mm I don't think they're thinking about uh a replica of Guantanamo Bay I don't think it's gunna be quite that ruthless but uh what they're saying is that what they'd need to do probably is hold  uh terror suspects for longer than we would normally hold criminal suspects for and be able to investigate them fully otherwise uh y'know it is it's it's possible that the authorities are gunna miss certain facts uh that could be critical.

 I've no problems there but these laws seems to be uh cutting across the whole board whole spectrum  so therefore I mean yes that might be a good law for today and everybody sort of understands but suddenly .

 It's on the books and so therefore it's there forever.

 That's right and therefore some policeman may have a small grudge against you maybe nothing major but suddenly he holds you for four hours or how many hours he's allowed to hold you whatever the case may be. It's just something and then lets you go you've got no recourse unless you've got good lawyers . And um  y'know money y'know you let these things go and I find that there should be I mean I I believe they should have powers and I believe they have a lot of powers. Mm but I think there there's gotta be a very tight scrutiny and like the last uh powers that were introduced with ASEO the only people that really scrutinised them were the Greens and at the end of the whole lot I actually wasn't quite satisfied um where the powers would end and and and I wasn't clear where what the powers actually were . And that's uh.

 So you the you you think it's important to underline the fact that it's still a democracy.

 Yes very much so and uh I believe they do have uh quite extensive powers now and just by giving more and more powers to the police actually creates more fear of the police than it does of the terrorists.

 Alright Steve thanks for your view Greg you uh have a general comment on on terror.

 Yes uh Tony.

 G'day Greg.

 I I was very impressed with the comments of uh Colin Steve and that other lady uh we're talking here raw patriotism and uh and I'm not taking away from the others who have a genuine belief in what they believe in they they believe in appeasement and so on. But my attitude is I go though a path and when I walk through Perth I I go through a sign that says those deserve peace who are prepared to defend it. Now that doesn't mean to say that I'm a warmonger . What I'm saying is if someone threatens my country I'm a defensive person not an offensive person  if someone threatens my country I'm right behind whichever political party is prepared to pick up the gear and go and I will do that I'll defend Bob Brown I'll say Bob righto Bob you wouldn't wanna pick up a a an M sixteen with me. I've gotta defend you and your family and you're gunna roll over uh and say y'know please don't hurt me it's uh ih uh I'm a good bloke. I said that that isn't the way these poor fanatics think . And I said the bottom line is that that sort of action those guys have got and they are fanatics and they are off the beam and .

 Well ih it makes it also very hard to defend against simply because you don't know exactly where they're going to go next.

 No and and of course if if they come into our territory any of these folks that do that then I say we need whatever powers that the government needs to defend against that I am only too happy to support it because I can walk through. They can arrest me any time they want to. I can walk through there I know that I will come out the other end okay. Now some of those blokes are a little worried about that. Think about it because um uh in our judicial system ih in the Westminster system of government we have a predication of innocence before guilt  and uh I uh I uh I think I couldn't put it better than Colin Eve and that other lady . And I won't try and go over that ground again Tony.

 But uh as far as you're concerned  we we we should uh.

  protecting my country and my family and  my grandkids.

 Y you believe we should be taking a a very aggressive uh investigative.

  it's not so much aggressive but a very positive stance towards protecting our country and we don't roll over and just lie down and go for appeasement. That's not my game and I I will support any government and I guarantee there's an awful lotta people behind me  that that says we will use whatever powers we have to to protect our kith and kin.

 Tt good to hear from you Greg thanks for that uh Tom you you believe public gatherings  could be a possible target here.

 Yes Tony. I just listened to that man and a couple of women before him  and I wonder where they live. Um  here in Toowoomba I I doubt that we've got any cause to worry because there are no gatherings big enough anywhere in toowoom  we don't have a train service . Sydney and Melbourne could be concerned about it but why about transport when they have for instance in Melbourne they have an anything up to ninety-thousand people gathered together for a game of football.

 Mm oh it's something we have to look at too I mean  y'know major sporting gatherings that sort of thing it ih y'know they all could be potential targets.

 But how do you guard against people who are prepared to blow themselves to pieces to take somebody else with them.

 Well I don't think you can.

 And I heard I heard a a few of your callers talking about  them the terrorists have done this to these innocent people in Spain. What the hell do they think that the coalition of the willing did  to innocent people in Afghanistan and and Iraq . Y'know and and as one of your callers said  nobody is dib is being bothered to find out why they are terrorists why they are doing this sorta stuff. How can you defeat something if you don't know why they're doing it . And and when they talk about a war against terrorism  you you can't win a war against terrorism you have to find some other way of doing it. And that doesn't mean rolling over and appeasement and all the rest of it. And uh I don't know where they get the idea that  um Bob Brown or Labor is prepared to roll over and and and appease the terrorists uh uh it's all I I I don't know I don't know where they   they they must just reach up into the m into into air and grab these things out out of mid air because.

 A l a lotta people believe that um y'know we shouldn't have been in Iraq in the first place  uh and and I think um y'know that's th th that's the attitude that they're reflecting.

 Tony John Howard said that that as far as he's concerned there's no link between uh the spai Spanish troops going into Iraq and and the bombing . Uh the majority of Spaniards don't agree with him. They they uh thought enough about it to uh ousted the government that took them into that. And uh uh I I don't kno I d I don't know you know  when they talk about Iraq  an and I heard Bush talking about protecting America from an attack by Iraq. And and we we're in this this sorta stuff too. Iraq was never a threat to us . And yet but we we attack it we we invade it without without any warning and and now we've we've got we've got people we've got people in Guantanamo Bay and as far as I'm I can see the most that they could charge them with is defending themselves against an armed attack.

 Yeah I think it'll be m little little more serious than that Tom by the sound of the uh military tribunal  but thank thanks for your thoughts Ian uh y y you believe we shouldn't run up a white flag under any circumstances.

  under no cir  pardon me g'day Tony under no cir uh circumstances  um I mean we are we're fighting people in these in these terrorists how I'd label them . They are they are diabolically evil they are fanatical and they are cowardly. And ih h the appeasement will will uh serves nothing. Wih wih they are utterly utterly committed to their cause and they pervert a noble religion Islam in so doing. Islam is not all about this. This is a perversion of it  the w the what they're what they are doing.

 Mm Osama Bin Laden's version is a very different one from  the Koran.

 Very different from what you'd find in the Koran and  very different from what would be preached by a a a balanced and scholarly uh mufti I'm sure . But um.

 I I understand your comment.

 Ih it's we we we just simply have to stand firm ap appeasement has never worked I mean look at look at history I mean yes yes there were innocent people were killed so were innocent people killed in the second world war but did we should we will we we feel constrained in our fight against imperial Japan and Nazi Germany because innocent people were going to be killed in bombing raids or shelling or whatever  no. Uh tragically this is part of war. And I have  um my life was  profoundly changed uh mm by the loss of my uncle in the second world war but that's that's another matter th so I mean I have no I have no reason to to be uh.

 A supporter of conflict but mm.

 War but I neither am I a pacifist but it. I've had to be realistic . I mean this is an occasion where we simply have to take up arms  we have to be alert and we we really I mean it it's going to be a I don't uh I don't think anybody you one would be a fool to imagine one could this could be something that could be won as it were overnight. It's going to be a protracted protracted affair.

 Well I think um president Bush indicated it could be twenty years it could be fifty years and uh I think he's not far off the mark. Ian thank you um I think we'd better call it a halt there. Thank you for the callers I'm sorry we didn't as always we didn't get through everyone um this uh will undoubtedly develop a little further this is the first day of a major conference that we're reflecting on uh and uh unfortunately the terrorist threat is uh mhm gunna be something we're gunna have to learn to live with.

Ends 2:06:24"
"

 So now it's welcome first to our expert panel. Dr Brian Edgar he is director of theology and public policy for the Evangelical Alliance a mainstream Protestant agency which have a website that canvases electoral issues. Brian welcome  to you.

 Thank you very much glad to  be here.

 Victoria Kearney is one of the coordinators of a website called PolMin which looks at lobbying for policies in harmony with Catholic social teaching Victoria welcome to you.

 Good evening John.

 And uh it's my pleasure to welcome in Adelaide Paul Newsham. Uh Paul Newsham is a pastor with the Northside Christian Life Centre an Assemblies God church at Gawler in South Australia Paul welcome to you.

 Thank you John.

 So first to you all the great mystery of this campaign for us what would Jesus do. Paul Newsham let me come to you first. Um  Christians seem to be getting organised  in political lobbies in a way that they haven't in previous election campaigns. Now is this something that has just spilled over from the United States or has there been a groundswell for a number of years. 

 I think it's been growing for a number of years I I think Christians um have withdrawn from politics for too long um and from from making their voice heard probably because we felt being in a Christian nation that our values were being maintained but I I think as we look now at our nation we probably would be hard pressed to call it Christian and I think our Christian values have also been undermined quite dramatically so Christians are just rising up and saying we want to have the values that we believe in.

 Well I guess the real question there then comes to be well there's two questions that occur to me  why in organised parties and uh what values. Let's address the organised parties question first and uh Brian .

 Now.

 There's a long history of Christian involvement with uh with with politics.

 Absolutely.

 Why uh what's the difference between Christians who get into politics just by becoming members of other parties and this current trend to see Christians particularly it seems to me  and I may be wrong uh Christians with a a particularly tight view on on social issues  getting organised in politics.

 Yes yes well ih yes uh Christians uh I I think at the moment are involved ih in in both levels very much uh there are those that are uh forming parties and and coalescing in that way. Um ih it's perhaps not so obvious that there uh are uh and have been for a long time a lot of Christians who are uh deeply involved in uh uh in politics but but not in in uh sort of that cohesive way it's uh it's Christians working within other parties. Uh and I think to some extent there are some uh uh sort of theological things that underlie why why people take a different approach to that  um ih it's possibly true that th perhaps the more conservative people do tend to to form parties a little bit more and I think it's possibly because of a slightly different view of the world. Um perhaps uh they see things a little bit more black and white and and perhaps the idea of uh of being uh separated from the world is perhaps a little bit a little bit stronger and so in a sense a a slightly different view of holiness of uh of working in a in a Christian community and not sort of being  unequally yoked with uh with people in uh in secular parties uh whereas on the other side there are there are people who would suggest that uh uh the best way to transform structures is by actually being involved in those structures and so try and work within uh political parties.

 Victoria Kearney let me bring you in here because there is a long history of Catholic social involvement with the community indeed  uh the church has been actively seen particularly in Europe uh over the last hundred years or so has been actively involved in uh creating political parties. Yet that seemed to go on the wane over recent years and you have more the tendency s uh uh to do as as Brian was describing for Catholics to get involved in parties and be the sort of influence within existing parties. Why has that happened what's been the shift there.

 I think that um  there there was th there was the argument between religion and politics and I think that people have uh probably taken a step back in terms of being involved in party politics  but our organisation is actually coming back into the political arena because they've recognised that they can work like a revolving door around poverty and welfare and structural problems  unless they actually get into the part t into the political arena they won't impact on that on those policy issues so we're coming back into politics but fo.

 But not as a party.

 Not as a party but as a ih on in relation to the policies themselves.

 Issue by issue.

 Yes.

 Paul that comes back to you then  why have you been an active supporter of getting Christians as organised groups to form political parties uh Family First is one party that you've been associated with being active in support of and I know that Family First has a lot of support in A O G Assemblies of God communities.

 Yeah I think I think John it has to be said that we've been active in getting people involved at all levels both the levels that have been talked about in the sense of uh people becoming actively involved in other  um parties uh getting involved in the political system p uh uh per se uh but also there's been this move in more recent times to get involved in uh a party as such. Um I I think it has to be said that Family First doesn't see themselves as a Christian party but uh certainly the majority of the people in there are Christian. But they're espousing the kind of vows uh views rather that Christians um of our type would be more likely to espouse I  I think.

 What do you mean by your type.

 Well  probably those of us who are strongly uh for family values and so on who have been I think um disappointed with the standards and the directions that some of the parties have been going  we. 

 Which parties in particular.

 Oh . Well y'know I I don't think any of the parties have specifically d uh targeted families as someone that they're concerned for. Um every party kind of has its um its group y'know the Labor party have uh targeted the working class the Liberals more the business  uh the Greens the environmentalists and so on. Um Family First party and others like them have felt that the family is someone who needs to be very much cared for and  it doesn't become a single issue in the sense that every piece of legislation just about that goes through any parliament is going to affect the family in some way and so  it's been felt by these people that family needs that kind of protection and and and I think that those people that are supporting parties such as Family First and others are very very strong that the family is the basic unit of society and that w if that goes down society goes down. So.

 Brian Edgar let   I'll have  to get in on that   we can't let you  run a party political ad here.

 I think I think this is actually another reason uh for why some Christians prefer to work in parties in that way Paul's pointed us to this  that that there are some for s from some people's point of view uh there are some certain specific issues that they say would say these are definitively the issues that uh that Christians need to get involved in and we can agree on those issues  whereas I think some of the Christians who uh don't get involved uh in in a a a Christian party in th in that sense or ih or a party of Christians  uh perhaps see that there are there are other issues as well I'm not suggesting that Family First are not concerned about issues of asylum seekers or justice or the war in Iraq or so on. But uh th the it seems that that the formal sort of more Christian parties ha have nominated uh largely family issues uh uh as as being the focus whereas those that are working through other parties are perhaps more  uh more focused on on some other issues or perhaps PolMin and others uh are more  y'know  based on specific policy issues rather than uh a a a party structure like that.

 Well l let's come to the point there and shift away from the the issue of how we organise in parties and come to that question of values. That is what are definitively Christian values that one could claim uh uh a mandate for in terms of going to people and saying look these are the values that Jesus would stand for this is what Jesus would vote on. Um for you Victoria Kearney what are the critical issues as a committed Catholic Christian that you say look Jesus would be right down the line one these.

 Okay I just wanted to make the point that PolMin has been very successful  having a bipartisan party political position. We've actually um reflected other people's positions and sharing sh recognising that we're actually sharing values across party positions. So that's where PolMin has made a difference particularly in say the water issue. But in terms of Jesus in terms of what the what the values that we operate on are the common good. The the the fact that it is the concept that is the cornerso cornerstone of Catholic social teaching. It says that all social conditions everybody should have access to equal social conditions. People.

 Equity then is it is it.

 Equity and and and equity in terms of fulfilment um fulfilment to the resources of creation fulfilment in terms of housing fulfilment in terms of uh education. So the com common good is one of the very strong cornerstones of our work. Um solidarity with those who are disenfranchised. If we don't protect the rights of the poor or the disenfranchised it affects all of us.

 Now you're picking up on a strand of Catholic social teaching that's been there for the best part of what a hundred and ten years now  since uh the famous um uh the famous uh w work uh by pope um tt.

 John  John.

 Well not John the twenty-third  but I'm going back a hundred years before that . Um  uh to to the whole issue of Catholic social teaching and uh um the condition of the the working classes that er document  that came out in eighteen-ninety um so the.

 You probably know more about the the the specifics of cashel Catholic social teaching than I do but what you're talking about is solidarity with those who are um not a y'know not disenfranchised and and s the the whole mutuality if we do for them we do for us it's a reciprocal arrangement it's it's for the for the good of all that we pull together. And so they they would be some of the values that we'd be looking at.

 Alright now Brian w what for you  you're you're coming as a director of theology and public policy from a group called the Evangelical Alliance which is a an umbrella body for a number  of of mainline protestant groups  I guess we could d describe .

 Yes we're we're not we're not in any sense a political party I mean we see uh people being involved uh in all sorts of uh different kinds of ways. I I I think some of the values that uh Christians have traditionally seen as y'know Christian values and and people have applied in their own lives  are actually really important social values that need to be expressed in terms that are appropriate for our community  take something like grace y'know a a y'know amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like ne me is normally seen as being something that applies uh to us the God has uh saved us by his grace but if grace was lived out as a a social value it would be profound because grace really means giving people what they don't deserve.

 Yes you've picked an  interesting example there uh with uh Amazing Grace written by John Newton  who was a converted slave trader of course who fought  for the abolition of slavery  so grace for him was a social value.

 Yes  that's right and uh uh uh had profound uh impact uh uh I might have mentioned th mentioned this to you earlier profound impact actually directly on Australian there's a direct line  between um John Newton and William Wilberforce uh in the in England Wilberforce uh was advised by Newton  not to give up politics uh Wilberforce was planning to go into the ministry and Newton said no don't go  do that y stay in politics and and Wilberforce uh mixed with William Pitt the prime minister then and it was at a a breakfast between uh Wilberforce and Pitt that they decided to send uh a chaplain out to the Botany Bay to the colonies here. So sort of direct straight line between John Newton and uh and Australia here.

 And and you say that that really defines a tradition within evangelical protestantism.

 Certainly. There has been a very strong tradition uh of soh social involvement in evangelicals I think unfortunately during the  twentieth century uh it slipped away. The n the nineteenth century was a tremendous time for for evangelicals in terms of social action and the twentieth century perhaps wasn't so hot 'cos I think a lot of evangelicals bought into the  sort of claim that there's a dichotomy a division between faith and work uh and and tended to privatise faith a lot but  uh part of the reason I think why in recent times there's been a lot more political involvement is that people are overcoming that very artificial distinction  uh that there's private faith and public values and people saying well look these  these values these Christian values that we have they're actually very important social values as well. I mean if we didn't have a society that was based on giving people more than they deserved how would that change our our attitudes in terms of uh the way we deal with uh with social welfare the way that we deal with uh asylum seekers and so on ih could would be quite radical.

 Uh Paul what Brian is saying there is picking up on much of what you said but I suspect you're coming from act actually radically different positions when you're looking at application of those values.

 Yeah I'm not so sure um first of all y'know I don't represent a political party I believe that any candidate who's upholding Christian values is really worthy of a a vote. Um I I I think that for me whether you believe we're a trichotomy a dichotomy or any other kind of otomy  um every area of our life is affected by our spiritual beliefs just as every  just as our spiritual beliefs affect every area of our are affected by every area of our lives. And so I think when it comes to our beliefs in politics and so on we need to be um bringing those values in but for me I'm very interested and I'm sure that  that the people that I've associated with in the past and and m candidates that have Christian values are very interested in the health of our people we we want our nation to have good health cover and good health protection we we want good education systems in our country and surely every  Australian wants that.

 Well let's talk about education 'cos there's a there's a really interesting issue. I um wuh y you support I would take it the um the uh the the position on on private schools that private schools should be um should be actively supported and that Christian schools should be actively supported.

 Y yes I would because I think that if parents choose that form of education for their children then they should be able to do that. I think it's.

 What if about that choice isn't economically available to them. That is I'm talking about where you get a situation where you've got to say as the churches did in debating this a hundred years ago  look if we privatised education we wouldn't have an adequate public system. So we've gotta have the public system first.

 Y yeah and and I acs fully accept that argument and I'm not gunna go against that I think however that part of the choice that parents make is whether or not they can afford a private education and many  many private schools of course do everything they can to help families that are underprivileged so that their children can still have some level of education in a private school. Um but to me it is a choice of parents and I think that it's also a good thing that governments support uh public uh private education as well as public education I don't think there should be competition here I think they should be working together but let's not forget that the parents who are putting their children into public s uh into private schools are still paying taxes as the s th under the same regime and to the same value as those that are in public school I I really don't think it should be a major issue. I think it again we should be making sure that our children are getting a good education whether they're in a private or a public school.

 Brian

 Yes well uh uhf have to say of this point say the Evangelical Alliance wouldn't have a a specific policy on that but it would be uh I think guided uh along lines of a a say if uh the principles of justice. Uh and biblicly speaking justice is a is a concept that's biased uh in favour of the disadvantaged so uh whatever policy one comes out with there it it needs to be uh a policy that works in favour of those who are most disadvantaged.

 And Victoria.

 Uh PolMin would probably support that s a similar position that we need to protect the rights of those who are disen disenfranchised. So we need to have access for the poor to education and then choice for those who wanna make a choice.

 You're on Sunday Night on A B C radio around Australia John Cleary with you. This evening we're asking the question how would Jesus vote. Now you might like to uh to register your opinion on our informal and utterly unreliable poll by giving us a call one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two. Around Australia if you're in the Sydney metropolitan area you can give us a ring on uh eight-triple-three-one-thousand eight-triple-three-one-thousand on Sunday Night how would Jesus vote.



 And on Sunday Night our guests this evening in the studio are Dr Brian Edgar director of theology and public policy with the Evangelical Alliance Victoria Kearney  oh from PolMin a uh a network uh um you can join PolMin actually if you wish to but uh a network of people concerned with uh bringing Catholic social teaching  back into the public policy debate and Paul Newsham of the Northside Christian Life Centre at Gawler in South Australia and of course you one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two or eight-triple-three-one-thousand let's say hi to uh to Damian in Ballarat and uh see what Damian has to offer Damian how are you.

 Good evening John.

 How do you think jee  how do you think Jesus'd vote

 Well personally I think he wouldn't vote we cuh couldn't expect him to vote . Not democratic Jesus y'know uh if we take the tax collector uh situation where he was asked or w Jesus was tempted uh and asked what y'know about the the coin that belongs to Caesar 'n' he told him that y'know what belongs to Caesar s y'know . Give him what belongs to him.

 Well let me  ask it another way what values do you think he would express.

 Well this is the values you wish forwould be God's law that's the whole principle of it. Uh and uh he uh we are imperfect y'know we can't keep the law. So how can you expect him  y'know to vote on .

 A a are you going to vote in this election.

 Sorry.

 Are you going to vote in this election.

 Yes 

 And would you allow your Christian ethics and principles to influence your vote.

 Most definitely.

 Ah .

 And that's the other point . To see the the Christian values when my brothers and sister there are asked these questions I find it hard to comprehend why they can't get their tongue around what are Christian values. They can never seem to put it out y'know.

 What are they for you.

 For me uh a decent moral life which we are not getting now all you have to do is listen to the  radio T V our screens advertising boards on the road.

 So this is personal morality you're talking about here.

 I think I don't think it's just personal morality I think it's a a national worldwide morality. Y'know uh if the structure of society uh we don't seem to learn by history. Y'know what .

 Do you make a differ a distinction between morality and justice.

 Uh I think morality does bring justice without it you cannot have justice that's why we have corruption  that's we wih uh we have uh y'know people uh being uh  s what's the word for it I'm just trying to think but y'know they're not receiving their uh entitlement in life because people are greedy they cheat they lie. Uh all these things add up to an immoral way of life.

 And they've certainly been issues that have been canvassed by politicians of both sides in this campaign so.

 And how can you expect Jesus then right to vote when he knows that both sides  will not be perfect.

 Gee uh I guess that's a question that goes profoundly  to the incarnation does it not uh  Brian.

 Well I wonder yeah I I it to some extent I I appreciate s uh Damian's point about what Jesus would do and so uh I I wonder too whether he would uh actually vote but I think for pfls perhaps slightly different reasons to to Damian uh because uh  ih if we imagine Jesus in the fir in the first century and if they'd had y'know full free and fair democratic elections uh  who would he have voted for and I think the the the the passage that Damian pointed us to y'know render to Caesar what is Caesar's and what ih to God what is God's  uh perhaps that mi actually might imply well render to John render to Mark what what belongs to them  uh and render to God what is what is God's um. But I I'd I'd be hard pressed to say uh how how how he'd vote I I wonder whether ih in actual fact he might even be a swinging voter .

 Victoria uh can.

 Well I m I mean I was sitting here thinking I mean after the debate tonight he might've gone into the temple and thrown the tables over and said I'm not voting for anyone I don't trust  ei either side.

 Yeah complicity  in the political  system.

 Is this capitalism or is this democracy and this is greed y'know I think his first reaction might have been quite angry. But I think he might have thought about the donkey vote y'know he was inseparable with his donkey wasn't he . But I think he would've given it a lotta thought after a while and started to think about the values a little bit more you know and  and what what it was that. I think he would have cast a vote eventually.

 Paul  let me ask you a question here. Uh you mentioned um t the family values up front and ih you've we mentioned your association with the Family First party. What ih  wh what is it that makes you associate Jesus in particular with family values.

 Well let me say first of all uh to Damian y'know his comment about us not getting our tongue around Christian values. Uh to me it's very very important that we recognise that righteousness exalts a nation economy and things like that don't but righteousness do that's that's a straight outta the bible statement and I'm a  a unashamed bible believer. Um tt what ih what makes me associate with family values is that what you said.

 W no what makes you particularly associate Jesus with family  values.

 Well I I I just see um Jesus and the teachings of his disciples for example the apostle Paul are very strong on family values uh y'know particularly you go into Ephesians five and so on. Y you just see the power of family in the teachings there. I think Jesus valued families greatly he valued individuals as well of course and and when we talk families I don't think we just wanna talk about the nuclear family or the husband wife and two kids I think the single mum with two or three children and  a and so on are are family. And because they are individuals uh but because God created family in the first place he has a very deep interest in them but I come back again to the fact that to my understanding family is the basic unit of society. When God created Adam he then created Eve and he put them together on the face of the earth to work together and I don't think that's ever changed. I think.

 Well it's it's interesting because when you look at the actually the way Jesus behaved it was actually different to that. You could I mean I'm not denying what you're saying but one could equally if one was getting into a bit of  biblical exegesis as they call it explaining the bible and unpacking it. Y you could actually build a case to say that Jesus was highly anti family in a way. That he actually never got married himself that he went out on the road  that Paul was anti family that Paul said look d only get married if you  if you if you have to y'know there is a better way in fact the church dev uh valued the idea of the single life very much that that this whole building of the family values thing is a really artificial construction that's not to say it's it's it's wrong it may be right but you could equally  build a  build a case the other way could you not.

 I think if you if you go through the teachings of Jesus he made statements about family and marriage and how sacred marriage was and a sexual relationship the whole thing so I don't.

 Yes but did he make it pre-eminent I guess is what I'm saying.

 Well if I if I.

 Brian .

 I d I don't think it's ei it's one or the other I uh uh wuh uh. I think evangelicals generally would want to have pretty strong stratements  on the on the family side and on the justice side I think part of the problem  has been these two things have been  separated uh too much uh. Somebody looked at our our website during the week and thought we were a bit left. Uh but I think that's only because perhaps they had identified the Christian issues with one side that is the family issues and type of thing which we have statements about uh but anybody who had statements about some of the other issues is obviously left now I think it's a matter  we have s   y'know it's important to have uh from our point of view yuh statements about uh family uh marriage uh uh same sex relationships views views about that as well as uh the justice issues.

 Absolutely I  I.

 Paul hang on we'll get Victoria in.

 Yeah just I just think that Damian made the point about private morality public morality and I think that  in some ways Jesus was a collectivist in that and a communal person because he stood in solidarity with the poor he was seen in groups um he was listening to one group versus the other group so  there he had a public role and a private role in terms of his morality and his failures so.

 Let's take some more calls Damian thanks for your call we're gunna have to move on  to uh to Bernard in in Melbourne hello Bernard how are you.

 Good evening. Um I'm concerned that uh some of your panel tonight is doing much the same branding that the political parties themselves do. Um to talk about uh evangelism as being on about the family and yet uh the evangelical movement is often  uh vehemently anti same sex relationships and uh glorifying material wealth and material success seems to me is very much anti family  and to talk about the Catholic church as being honour bound uh to common good and justice  when as a Catholic I have to say that the internal administration of the Catholic church resembles farm more Stalinist uh Soviet Union than it does  the mercifulness and forgiveness and compassion of Jesus um really means that br a brand a particular brand is being put forward rather than the truth and in that way resembles the uh the major parties much more than it does the uh simple humble merciful and loving message that Jesus gave.

 I think we'd get Victoria to respond to that Victoria.

 Okay um I'd like  I'd like to just say that PolMin is not part of the mainstream church. Um we have members who are c obviously Catholics and and our teaching is Catholic but we're we're definitely an independent Catholic lobby organisation which which I guess  um entitles us to our own position whi which doesn't neccessarily reflect the the mainstream of the church.

 Are you suggesting you have some sympathy with with what Bernard's saying about the institutional church  er as as religion  with a capital R . Mm.

 I means our bishop in in Parramatta came out last week and talked about public morality in voting. Now we would definitely support that and be very proud of the fact that Bishop Manning said that  and we would say that publicly but that doesn't neccessarily mean that  uh PolMin is an independent organisation from the mainstream of of the structure of the church in Australia.

 Brian the church does have a bit to answer for as an institution uh be it all all the denominations uh  how does one respond to that do you actually.

 Well yes I I think in general the the the point that's made there is is uh one about humility y'know uh who who does speak for God and and do we speak  too decisively uh and the Church probably well cer certainly has at times uh spoken too decisively about uh y'know saying what what God wants and I think we have to uh be very humble in uh in speaking for God but  in a sense not speaking is uh is worse we have to  uh s do and say what we can but recognising w we we don't have the full truth and ih indeed that's actually what lies behind say the um the doctrine of the separation of church and state  uh which is as much a theological as a political doctrine which is saying look there is a certain danger  in in the church trying to pretend that it has all knowledge and can definitively say what what God wants. Um.

 Is that the danger of the church become like a political party because it could  achieve government and then be in the position of being both Caesar  and Christ.

 Yes there there's there is a t a significant distinction between the separation of church and state which I think is very important doctrine  and the uh separation of Christians and politics now I think Christians should be involved in politics and I don't think they should be separated but they at the formal level of church and state it's uh it's a dangerous thing.

 Let's move on to uh to Pam in Melbourne hello Pam welcome.

 Hello how  are you.

 Good what would you like to say.

 Well I'd I think that he would be he would vote for an environmental party because I think we'll all have to answer for what we've done to the creation. And that he would be a socialist because of the values of sharing having enough but not being greedy having compassion being honest and having a stewardship.

 Okay Ralph we'll get you to uh sorry we'll get you to respond to that now p Paul rather.

 Um I I'm quite that Jesus would be very interested in the environment and very concerned for it and I'm I'm absolutely certain that his values include sharing and so on. I'm not sure whether he would fit into an environmentalist party or a socialist party but I do think that Jesus Christ would vote if he were going to vote and by the way voting is secret in our country so he probably wouldn't ever tell us. Um .

 Wh why do you say though you don't think he fit into an environmentalist or a socialist  party.

 No I'm saying I'm not sure if he would and I'm not sure where he would throw his persuasion in fact because Jesus would be wanting to see the whole of our society helped and strengthened um and so I think he'd be looking for the opportunity to help in every one of those areas and probably find that each one of the parties fell short in one area. Um for example if he went to an environmental party he might find that there are things in there he didn't like and so he'll go then looking for somewh I don't there's just no perfect  party is there.

 I think that's ih if I can say I think that's laid behind my slightly uh cynical comment before that Jesus was a m might be a swinging voter . It's just because it's a little difficult to imagine him saying well  uh look it's all the way with the Liberals or it's it's I'm a dyed in the wool Labor Labor person .

 But surely that's what parties like the Christian Democratic party are doing.

 Uh well I'd even say look we we y'know that they're the same kind of issues will arise there Christians themselves are not entirely agreed about what Christian values involve so  I I I don't here in Australia I don't eeh I I don't think I've heard  Christian Democrats saying oh look uh  uh this is the only party that somebody uh could possibly vote for I th uh there's more of that in the U S but I think I think we're a little more laid back in Australia . Uh I have had some peoples tell me  uh in the last couple of weeks who who uh who Jesus would not vote for  uh or come pretty close to it but I haven't heard too many people say well  he would only vote for this or that uh party.

 Let's go to uh to Mark in the Blue Mountains Pam thanks for your call Mark hi how are you.

 Hi good thanks good. Look I I think Jesus would definitely vote I think he would be a social activist I also think he'd be politically very concerned about issues of health education affordable housing and also um work places that offered safety and and and a bit of security and justice. I think he'd be very concerned about contemporary issues of that affect politics of today I I don't  I I wouldn't see him being aligned to uh conservative politics at all I think I think that would be quite alien.

 You see that that makes my point about people being more clear about who he wouldn't vote for than the than the who he would.

 Maybe so.

  Uh ih Mark had you finished your uh your your delineation there.

 Yes.

 Well we we'll might get another couple of calls in and then come back for some uh some general comments 'cos we've got lots of people calling in  with some opinions on this thanks Mark for your uh for your observations. To Michael in Rooty Hill hello Michael what would you like to say.

 How you going. Yeah I I um I I really can't say what I think the Lord would who who who who he'd vote for but I  I I would like to say this that uh w one time he spoke to a um a lawyer who had a y'know the correct theological answer. But uh the Lord pointed out the the missing ingredient which was compassion. And I believe that uh y'know a lot of  Christian politicians and y'know the people that y'know standing up for family values et cetera yeah are doing the the right thing y'know but but we must not miss miss the compassion part. And and by compassion I don't mean y'know watering down values but I mean y'know being conscious of uh y'know certain issues like uh y'know we had the  the asylum seekers at one stage y'know and uh and y sometimes y'know we we can close our hearts and our ears because we're so busy just y'know doing what what we ough what we oughta do but sometimes we we miss out  the ingredient that that has to fit in as well. And I think um y'know there are  certain  Christian groups that that are trying to find a balance and and that's that's where I'd like to um y'know I I mean I I I I do have in mind who I'd like to vote for. Uh and han han an and and comes close to that but um yeah that's ih it's just finding the balance of  of of having the the Christian morals and and the principles which you can't water down but but also having the compassion that comes with it.

 Thanks for that observation  Michael uh who'd like to pick that up Brian you were wanting to say something.

 Well yes I think I think that Michael's got a good point there uh y'know pointing us towards those values again uh uh uh at the end of the day God is not going to say uh hey did you get an annual growth rate of six percent. He's gunna say did you uh do justly did you love mercy did you show compassion did you walk humbly with God those those are the things that  we're gunna be asked about.

 I fully agree with that John and I uh as I've talked with politicians across the board I find some that are moved with compassion 'n' some that aren't and and that's across the board and I I really do think that it all goes back to motive in many ways why are we in there and  and what is our purpose for being there compassion is without a doubt very important 'n' and I ih going back to the asylum seekers which the caller mentioned um I I think if our if we weren't moved with compassion on that one we really need a needed to go back and have a look at our motives. Jesus certainly would have been.

 Mm I think I think um y'know in terms of s Mary Magdalene was a prostitute he stood he stood beside her and and saw that her position in society was not just as a result of her personal choice. She nee y'know in terms of access to education in terms of having ih empowering people to live their lives fully I think that's what he would've he would've seen as a priority. And I think that we're getting caught up in um a few extra dollars in our pocket. Will those few extra dollars change society as a whole  for all of us and I think that we need to look beyond just the the short term economic gain and look at how we can empower ourselves as a society as a whole .

 Let's go to uh to Caleb at the uh at the Twelve Apostles hello Caleb.

 How are you tonight.

 Yeah a very significant place to preach from tonight what would you like to say .

 Yes that's right um tonight at church we had a friend who's children um h do home schooling and he's um the principal brought out about um the gay marriages been um going for a w while and they got t together with the prime minister and he's like said he's not going to let that happen which was really good and all the Christians got together and um and which I was really pleased to hear it um read out tonight and with their um thing you're talking about the families 'n' everything um. I just just don't know why this day and age all the families like they can't won't that they'll get married sorta thing and not live with each other and I mean Christ wouldn't want that to happen down on earth and that sorta thing so.

 Okay well we got uh thuh. Victoria that's tends to be a little ag leaning the other way from what you're saying I mean you gave the illustration of of Christ and the woman caught in adultery and others . Whereas our caller was saying well look you know on the gay marriage thing Jesus'd say no.

 Mm I think I think Jesus supported diversity I I think he understood um why people in society who are poor did the things they did or  resorted to and we have the same very similar things that are happening today. Um y'know we look at even security and say terrorism. Is terrorism based on the result of corruption and poverty and fear y'know I mean people I think Jesus would see why these things are happening in our world why and h I think he would be saying look the U N's really important. Y'know we need to work this out cooperatively and rather than y'know.

 He was a globalist.

 Yes and rather than a blame game y'know like these people are dreadful and it's evil I think he would be saying um let's look at the causes let's work together to sort the problem.

 We've got.

 Although I agree with although I agree with that comment I think we can't uh lose sight of the fact that Jesus did make very definitive statements about things and the woman taken in adultery he didn't just say poor lady. Although he had incredible compassion for her and I trust that we will but he actually said don't do it anymore.

 Did he help her out of her hole though.

 Absolutely she would've been a changed woman . But she was empowered to go away and not do it anymore.

 And I think that that's what the common good says is that you provide opportunities so people can change not just say that if you work hard and and your you'll find your way out of that hole I think sometimes we need to actually support those who are not able.

 Absolutely.

 Why is it um Paul do you think that currently the overt appeal in terms of politicians  going for the Christian vote has tended to be focussed almost directly on the appeal to the conservative side of Christianity with with um clearly Peter Costello and Tony Abbott making direct appeals for what they see as Christians who share conservative values. It's almost as though y'know Jesus would vote this way from their perspective . Why does that have such a resonance for them.

 I I think part of it is because they have noticed in recent years that the Christians are standing up and saying that we want change and we want things to be the way we believe they should and so for example I was in the meeting where uh Peter Costello spoke to Hillsong um there was something like twenty-one-thousand people present now that's a pretty good place to make your speech. Um now I'm not being totally cynical but I do think that they have realised that the  the the Christians are beginning to rise up and have a voice and so.

 But on the f by the same token we've only got a few minutes sorry to cut you off only got a minute or so left. In the Labor party you have people who are just as publicly Christian people like  Beazley reverend  Brian Howard deputy prime minister an  ordained minister  Michael Tate now a  Catholic priest  um Simon Crean uh these are people who are are overt in their Christian resonance yet um uh Brian Edgar they don't seem to .

 Well I think part of it is that that the um  uh is that it is the the the evangelical or the or the conservative ends th the where the churches are growing that's where where a lot of the people are at I think that's uh probably part of part of the issue. But it is interesting at the end of the day that Christians tend not to vote terribly differently in terms of proportions to the rest of the population. So they're there voting for for Labor and the and the other parties as well there's not a radical difference.

 Final word Victoria.

 I'd I'd I'd yes I'd I'd like to just say that I think there's a difference between spirituality and Christian perspective and theh  there is a very strong growth in in spirituality that is progressive in its view.

 And more people are gunna take values issues into account do you think.

 Yes I think so.

 Final word with Victoria Kearney you've been on Sunday Night a debate  about what would Jesus do in the case of the electoral process.

 Well those boys  from the uh Today Today show  calling you anal . Th they do not have the radio time  to go bagging you like that.

 Well y'know I'm so glad you called Dan because when I heard them call me anal this afternoon um I got a little bit distressed by that Dan and I gave them the finger through the window . Quite the finger actually quite a big large finger.

 Good good good that's what I like to hear no I mean y'know like if y'know people with jokes not laughs  uh are hanging shit on our beautiful Rosie nah.

 What's that throwing stones saying.

 What's that.

 Don't throw.

 Oh yeah in a glass house.

 Now Dan the thing is I admit  to being organised. I admit.

 There's nothing wrong with that.

 I I like to have everything in its place and I don't know where it's come from ever since I was little I lined up my dolls on a table.

 That's right and I was almost gunna wear shoes for formal Friday in the truck  but not now. No I'm sticking with the double pluggers.

 Ah Dan I like you  and I'm glad that you're actually sticking up for me for those two I don't know what we should call them on the afternoon at three o'clock.

 Oh I think I think wuh wuh we'll wait for their retort. I think we'll ah we'll just wait and see what they come up with and then we'll bag them totally.

 Oh I told them they'd better watch out 'cos I might just divert their phones to some particular one-nine-hundred number they don't wanna know about.

 You see what they forget Rosie is that you get the last call on Friday . We can just wipe them out.

 That's right Dan wipe them out . Have you got some sorta horn in your road train tonight.

 Which one did you want I just heard stick it in your arse.

 No it was When You are Asleep I Auction your Arse it's by Holly Vallance it's a brand new single it's gunna be a hit man  great stuff.

 Ah Lindsay Lindsay Lindsay  where are you right now.

 I don't know I'm jet lagged it's four A M and I'm in fact I'm just out the back of uh the Metro in George Street in the city I'm uh at Mother Chu's Vegetarian Kitchen. It's my bloody birthday goddamn it.

 Happy Birthday.

 Well ih it was actually two days ago but y'know birthdays go for a week in the rock and roll industry.

 They certainly do .

 I'm having I'm doing the most rock and roll thing I can possibly think of and having dinner with my parents.

 And what did they give you for your birthday Lindsay.

 Uh my mother gave me a  an organic fruit juicer. Hell no.

  An organic fruit  juicer.

 Absolutely and uh my dad gave me a very humorous Leunig T-shirt with a Mark Latham comic on it because  he's a funny man. What's that sorry.

 What does it say Manboobs.

 No it's uh some strange Leunig comic I didn't get to read it I'm sure it's very humorous and subversive I don't know.

 Your your dad's pretty good at giving you the crazy T-shirts.

 He does he does yeah uh dads like to do that I don't quite get it myself.

  What's where have you been what's been the latest with Frenzal Rhomb.

 Oh goodness we got back from Europe bit like two days ago fact my birthday present from the world was getting to sit on a plane for twenty-five hours . To get back from uh from London Heathrow but it was cool yeah we spent twenty-one days in Europe touring with the Dropkick Murphys and uh Roger Miret from Agnostic Front new little pop rock combo.

 Righto  the Dropkick Murphys are about to come here too so  maybe you'll meet up with them.

 Yeah we're hooking up with them in Adelaide we'll swab the decks finger each other in the arses y'know all that sorta shit.

 So did you do the uh the joy to the world photo that you do so well on your website.

 We d we did I did indeed and you think I have I have offended so many people with that thing around the world  we were doing it y'know we were doing it like the the monument all over the place everyone's like. Were in Dublin and I think I upset a few hard-core Catholics over there.

 What what new photos have you got on your website have you loaded them up yet.

 Oh I've uh in fact we just uploaded today a whole bunch of photos from our gig at the Astoria in London  and a whole bunch of stuff of us getting drunk and putting our fingers up  sleeping people's noses and stuff like that.

 And for anyone who hasn't seen your joy to the world finger to the world . What's your website again Lindsay.

 It is Frenzalrhomb dot com dot A U.

 And you can um.

 And it's uh got it's got a brand new look too and you can make our heads explode on the front page of the website it's very cool it's very exciting.

 Oh you've gotta be into that.

 Absolutely.

 So um you gave the finger to quite a few new y'know  international monuments.

 So many international monuments on this tour it was amazing.

 What do your parents say when they see that.

 They don't know how to use the computer they're about a hundred years old.

  Now you're touring with the Bouncing Souls  tell me about them.

 They're tremendous we just sort of said g'day to them today they're uh we've been mates with them for years done like the Warped Tour in America with them and stuff. They're uh yeah they're from New Jersey they sing songs that go whoah oh oh ooh oh.
 Wheeh di dah di dah.

 Which is great and they uh sing about having fun and stuff 'n' it's really cool and they like when we make jokes about them and call them rude words 'n' they do the same thing to us  so we get on fine.

 So um is it sort of like a competition between the two bands as to who can be the crudest for their warm up.

 Nah not so far. So far they're oh they're they're tougher than us 'cos they've got tattoos and shaven heads so  we're kind of scared to do anything at the moment but uh y'know as as I'm sure as the as the days wear on we'll we'll wear them down and we'll get to do what we need to do with them.

 So do you play who drinks the fastest gets the most.

 Of course who ge who ge who drinks the fastest gets the most drunk I guess that'd be about it.  And embarrasses themselves the most.

 And Lindsay when's the follow up to Sans Souci.
 
 It's well actually in a couple of days time we're bringing out a brand new uh C D which is called For the Term of Their Unnatural Lives  and it's a compilation of all our old stuff that people can't buy any more unless they look in the bargain bins of uh your local K Mart. Uh yeah so it's got like our first two releases and a bunch of B sides and stuff that the first time around we didn't think was very good but now we're just trying to flog it off for a couple of extra bucks.

 And are you gunna have a D V D component.

 No I don't know I mean.

 Ah come on.

 Oh we're gunna oh we're very lazy you know .

 Oh come on I'd love to see behind the scenes with you guys.

 Well we we've got a whole bunch of video footage that we're ready to put into a D V D but we we're not very good at that sort of technological aspect of it.

 You just hand it over to someone else.

 Yeah we could but then they'd sorta take out all the good bits and make us look like the Backstreet Boys and we prefer  to look like the back side boys so well we're working on it ourselves once we get the necessary technology together we'll definitely be bringing out a D V D.

 Lindsay do you reckon your mum or dad'll go on the radio and say hello.

 Um well they're kind of in the restaurant and I'm outside looking at all the heroin addicts so it might be a bit hard I can  put on my dad's voice and pretend.

 Ah no that's alright.

 Hello it's uh it's Peter McDougal here uh uh the lin I would  like to have Lindsay stop going on the radio please.

 And how's Jay's secret back room going.

 Ih Jay's oh  yes no we can't talk about that too much on the air but  let me just tell you his gardening skills have uh ih ih ec have expanded exponentially. He's uh he's he's really a master of horticulture at the moment.

 Oh he's a good man kisses  to the rest of the band from me.

 Thank you very much Rose  we shall see you very soon I'm sure.

 Oh look um I hope you have a good gig tonight at the Metro  then you're off to Blacktown R S L.

 Blacktown R S L tomorrow night yeah it's gunna be sweet.

 Then off to Richmond Newcastle Gold Coast Brisbane Canberra Adelaide.

  doesn't stop it stop doesn't stop I tells you.

 I hope  your mum brought you the seven days of Rio undies.

 Oh my mum actually brought me uh a homeo a hoh m my mum owns a health food store and she brought me a homeopathic kit to keep me alive on the road . So that'll be good but everyone's gotta come down to the Annandale on the twenty-sixth of this month to see the Bouncing Souls they're doing their own headline show which means we don't get to play which is better for everyone. And uh everyone's gotta come and uh throw things at them.

 Ah so you get to stand up the front 'n' 'n' and um  give them the shit.

 Abso and get drunk without having to worry about playing the right chords afterwards.

 Ah well Lindsay nice talking to you thanks for  speed requesting.

 I'll speed request any time Rosie.

  Punch in the Face for you.

 Cheers.

Anyway look coming up tonight after nine uh a band that show that perseverance definitely pays off uh a group from Ballarat which is in country Victoria who have been working on their latest album for about two years and finally after  they had to go they didn't have enough money to finish the album so they'd go and do a gig and then they'd go and work on another song .

 Of course he is from the Red Hot Chilli Peppers John Frusciante A Mission on Super Request actually that was actually track one so I must actually say that's Song to Sing When I'm Lonely. Naughty me Louis in Melbourne good evening to you.

 Hello Rosie.

 It's been quiet the scab grab tonight Louis.

 Yeah.

 Do I say Lewis or Louis.

 Louis.

 Louis okay. Louis.

 Yes.

 Who's this .

 John Butler.

 Are you sure.

 Yes .

 Do you know what tune.

 Uh Treat Your Mama.

 Oh  you're the winner.

 Awesome.

 You know you were up against another girl who got the exact tune as well so congratulations the scab grab coming your way okay.

 Cool.

 Baseball cap.

 Yep.

 An autographed Street Press.

 Yeah.

 And also a bucket.

 Yeah.

 Not bad eh.

 Yeah.

 Don't forget the encore of John Butler Trio on Sunday at five. See you Louis.

 See you Rosie.



 As you know the boys on Today Today are having formal Friday tomorrow and yeah I suppose I'll put on a bit of an effort. But I thought we'd have feral Friday here at Super Request where you can request in your undies and wear no shoes. And Ian in Darwin reckons that we should have freeball Friday what do you think of that Sam. You into a bit of freeballing.

 Y'know I got freeball and feral going at the same time here at the moment it's disgraceful.

 Sam you're a sick man in uh I don't mean I mean that literally you've got the flu .

 Yeah .

 You poor thing . Is someone taking care of you and giving you lots of fluids.

 Ah I got some salad for dinner so that's okay.

 You got some salad are you drinking lots of water Sammy.

 Yeah I have I just I just finished my two litres so.

 Two litres.

 I'm getting better .

 Ah you poor thing.

 Talking's not very good at the moment.

 I think you'll be going in um. To the toilet a bit  tonight .

 All going well.

 Are you not you're sure you're not sleeping with Nat the rat.

 Nat no I'm.

 'Cos Nat the rat's sick tonight too. Ah hang on  hang on. You sure you're not with Nat the rat.

 Uh I had some mice in my house but I killed them with Ratsak but I don't think so.

 Oh maybe she's one of them.

 Well  hope not. Poor thing.

 Well it's time it's time for me to say goodbye now Sam would you like to say goodnight Australia.

 Goodn goodnight Australia.

 And hello Robbie Buck.

 Uh hello Robbie.

 I hope you're feeling better.  I must say thanks  to mad Madeleine and Milo tonight. And get well Nat the rat I know you're out there partying I know where you are. Gus and Frank.

"
"  you're with Mel in the morning it's fourteen after eleven which means it is Dr Karl time. Good morning.

 Good morning we're having a multimedia extravaganza here.

 We are there's a lotta things going on over your side of the desk.

 And on your side we've got you in the picture we've got Danielle working the webcam and occasionally you can see that I've brought in in honour of the uh f topic of today which is water a book by Philip Ball called H two O a Biography of Water and I now realise how little I really know about water.

 A biography of water so has water had an interesting life and done a lot of things.

 Well it goes around and around every time you're drinking in some water you're drinking uh several million molecules that were urinated out by Jesus Christ or moh and Mohammed and uh Salvador Dali and Napoleon and everybody else you care to think of.

 What a fantastic way to look at it.

 Just goes around and around and around.

 Oh that's gunna freak me  out in many a quiet moment Dr Karl l let's just jump straight into it shall we . Naomi from Adelaide good morning.

 Good morning.

 Thank you  so much for holding.

 You're so welcome.

 Now fire away question for Dr Karl about water.

 I'm actually wondering whether the amount of water on the earth can ever change so whether there can be any more or any less.

 Uh both are happening. Um if you look at uh any say gas or liquid the molecules are y'know jittering around. Some of them are going slow most of them are going at the average piece uh s s speed and a small number of them are going really really fast. So think about water vapour  y'know little molecules of  hydrogen  with an angle of a hundred and four point five degrees according to this fine book in a so it looks like a little boomerang H two O and some of them are moving fast enough to beat the escape velocity of planet earth which is about I think eleven kilometres per second so off they go and they don't come back.

 Oh so they actually escape  the earth's atmosphere and they're away.

 A and they're gone but the theory is that there are meteors no ast uh sorry little comets hitting the earth's atmosphere all the time  and injecting water into our atmosphere. And occasionally they're very big normally it's y'know a tonne here a tonne there  uh yeah just sorta pitter pattering away all the time but occasionally these incoming comets are so big that American presidents have been woken because it's been thought there's been a nuclear burst in the upper atmosphere and the amount of energy is equal to the amount of energy released by a nuclear burst so you've got water molecules escaping  because some of them got enough escape veloh they're moving fast enough to escape and you've got more coming in and I don't know where the exact balance whether it's more one way or the other.

 But generally around the same level.

 Ish ish you're not gunna find the oceans changing a lot.

 Oh there  you go Naomi you feeling satisfied.

 Yes thank you very much.

 Excellent  no worries mate now Fiona you got a question for Dr Karl this morning.

 Uh yeah I do.

 Fire away.

 Um my question is um when water is absorbed through the body  um uh you have these products on the market at the moment and they're saying that they're water but they're actually being like slightly flavoured with different products. Does the body still recognise that as water.

 So these cordials that they uh term sports water that they think is just fantastic for us.

 Yes.

 Well yes and no sometimes your body can't recognise water. Until fairly recently say twenty years ago we used to have fifteen million children dying every year from the terrible five Ds which were infectious disease leading to diarrhoea dehydration and death. And so you've got these little kids and it's really scary when they're under eighteen months although even in a full size adultlike me or Mel or Danielle um or even Bernie Collie and Tristan downstairs in the lab. Sucking up to them as well. In a full size adult if you're hit with major diarrhoea from cholera you can lose ninety litres of water a day.

 What.

 Wow.

 You don't have ninety litres so well before  the fir the first day is gone you're dead you've dehydrated your way out of existence but we adults are fairly tough it's the little kids under eighteen months they can just drop off the perch. And so you've got these kids who are dehydrating  and you're thinking okay I'll shove some water down their neck mate it just goes straight through. And one of the great inventions of the twentieth century was the realisation that if you added the right amount of salts to make it somewhere around the the saltiness of blood they could absorb it. And suddenly to rehydrate a kid you didn't need an expensive needle giving set and bags and pipes which'd be per head the total budget of some third world country. You've just got this sachet stuff called gastrolite is one brand there's other brands we took some to India 'n' Nepal with us and you just add water to it in the right amount and then you drink it and your body can absorb it. So you're right what you're saying  that y'know like sometimes pure water you can't absorb . And you gotta add chemicals to it and then the other way round sometimes the chemicals that have been added may or may not stop you from uh absorbing it I don't know I do know that if you're having some of the sports drink they'll help set off a stitch.

 Really.

 Yeah.

 Which seems to be a contradictory to what they should do.

 Well there's a guy called Darren Morton who's at the Avondale college north of around Newcastle ih in New South Wales  and he's been looking at the stitch and there's been y'know what what the heck's going on when you got a stitch. Like you think oh it's because you're not very well trained y'know and but uh y'know like one fifth of highly trained athletes you couldn't train any more they'd drop dead  get stitches and you say oh it's because you're you're bouncing up and down all the stuff inside your gut is bouncing up and down and sort of going along with that is the fact that you've got these guys in the begin in towards the end of the second world war um uh whole lot of troops going from England to France they did some practise runs in these boats bouncing up and down  they got stitches. Not not running just standing in one spot they're going up and down they get the stitches so you think  okay it's because the organs are bouncing up and down but then on the other hand you have swimmers now swimmers don't bounce around. And they get stitches one fifth of y'know  Olympic grade s swimmers get stitches so they think it's the twisting of the ligament uh uh ih ih it's the membrane that covers your entire gut which goes from the bottom of your lungs to the top of your legs it's called the peritoneal  uh membrane  and this membrane absorbs uh it can be irri irritated and when you've had a big meal uh or you've dun drunk some of these sports drinks  the sports drinks are the wrong saltiness and they demand water from everywhere and some of it comes from the  the the the gut wall and some of it comes from this membrane the peritoneum. Uh.

 Right 'cos the body has to equalise  the the salts right.

 So ih ih it's a f it's a fairly complicated question like  you'd have to look at each individual sports drink and see if they work 'cos some of them they've said oh well I've just made this up over the years and it works with .

 So they have to be isotonic don't they.

 Yeah well some uh this I don't know. Um um I think it should be isotonic which means the same saltiless  a as the human body but I'm not sure because I I I just haven't chased this up maybe somebody can email us and tell us on the homepage.

 Oh nice one Fiona thanks for your call mate.

 Alright cool thanks.

 It's a very deep question Fiona  . Very deep.

 Have you got a little baby in the background there mate.

 Oh yeah I've got a three month old in my arms here. So yeah.

 Oh really does your baby sleep during the night.

 Uh yes she does.

 I'm so  glad for you and I'm so jealous oh you you too . You lucky thing. At least somebody's happy.

  I put her down at six and she won't wake up till maybe six.

 Oh  stop it  stop it now  you're just  being a show off  Fiona . See you later mate you have a good day.

 Yeah you too.

 Now  Scott you got a question for Dr Karl.

 Dr Scott.

 Yeah I do indeed uh good morning Dr Mel duh good morning Dr Karl.

 Good morning.

 Uh it's actually raining here in Caloundra as we're speaking so water's falling from the sky.

 Nice.

 Caloundra is  suburb wuh.

 North Sunny Coast.

 Sunny co is that l lower Queensland.

 Yes.

 Uh just north of Brisbane dot Dr Karl.

 North of Las Vegas okay yep.

 Beautiful part of the world. Um.

  very nice fruit up there too.

 Yeah indeed. Just uh wanna follow up on a movie I saw a couple of years ago um Escape of the Birdmen where they extracted scientists that were working on the Germans' nuclear program for and they were using heavy water. I just wanna know what heavy water is and whether it's safe enough to have an application today instead of using uranium.

 Oh okay um there's an atom called hydrogen which is this y'know there's a whole bunch of elements.

 Yep.

 Y'know and y'know hydrogen iron sulfur. They're all elements and you can't break them down much further with ordinary chemistry  and there's one called hydrogen which is the smallest one and it's got in a core it's got one proton  and it's got one neutron proton's positive and then going around it's got a single electron I'm just holding this up to the camera here . For for Mel there see s you got a central core proton  and neutron in in a central core and you got an electron one single electron going around it and that's about as simple as you can get for an atom.

 Right.

 Now  there's one proton and one neutron. Heavy water can have two neutrons or three neutrons with the same number of electrons and protons  and the neutrons are what are necessary to make a nuclear reaction happen . So you've got yourself let's go to the other end of the scale uranium big heavy element  and it's got a central core and you're sort of thinking central core but mate it's not a hard little thing like an orange or a golf ball it's wobbling around like jelly on a plate and every now and then it breaks down by itself.

 Oh okay.

 If you throw neutrons at it you make it break. And when you throw in one neutron you get three neutrons off. Man you're on the way to a chain reaction you're gunna have major major   uh big big kabooms is the technical term or the stuff that goes bang is the other term as well.

 Yeah.

 So heavy water is a a purely manufactured substance it doesn't exist naturally in the world.

 Oh it it does in very small percentages and you've gotta filter it out and it's really really really oh hello we've got a picture of it on the web cam. Thank you Danielle. Okay everybody capture that picture. There's a proton and a neutron in the middle so we've done that  so it it does exist and you've just gotta filter it out and because it's got so many more neutrons it has certain uses with making things go bang and killing other people.

 Oh that's no good.

 No.

 Um but.

 The th there is a g good trick you can do with it. You make ice out of it. And it sinks. And you g  you do this do this.

 That'd be a good party trick.

 Yeah y ah well  trouble is it's really expensive so you gotta try and y'know s so okay I've gotta get it out and put it into so separate container now because it's really expensive but  boy does that mess with people's minds when the ice sinks.

 I don't know what kind of party you'd be having  to use that one as a party trick Scott and if for your guests to actually be impressed by it.

 Yeah .

 Good on you mate thanks for your call Scott.

 Thanks a lot.

 Thank you Dr Scott.

 Let's take a track right now from T Z U we're talking to Dr Karl about water so please give us a call one-eight-hundred-oh-triple-five-three-six you're on Triple J twenty-four after eleven.



 And uh that track we heard was Holy Roman before that out of Melbourne T Z U gave us Good Dog from uh their record Position Correction you're with Mel in the morning and Dr Karl talking about water and showing us some amazing pictures on your little computer there Karl.

 That's right the Hubble space telescope the Hubble space telescope has done this um ultra deep picture they did a deep picture where they just stared the telescope at a boring bit of sky where there was nothing  and they saw all these galaxies and now they've done the ultra deep which is like staring through a five metre long straw at a tiny bit of sky  and you can download it off the Hubble space site it's just come down yesterday either the uh forty-four K version or the five-hundred K version or because I'm at the university the hundred and twenty meg version . And um it took a whole ten minutes to download shucks what a long time  there must be a lotta traffic and you just look at this picture and there's a few spots and you just go in and in and you see galaxies and galaxies there's ten thousand galaxies there. If.

 It's just amazing because you look at the picture initially and it looks mwih  a bit blah . Yeah a few  pinholes in a piece of black cardboard  and as you go in and in and in these amazing spiralling galaxies.

 Galaxies and each galaxy has around four-hundred-billion stars and maybe ten-billion of them have planets. And there's about four-hundred-billion galaxies but this one photo has got ten-thousand galaxies and I've gotta also apologise  for making mistake heavy ordinary hydrogen has one proton in the core and no neutrons oh silly me. So if it has one neutron it's called deuterium 'n' that's heavy hydrogen if it has two uh neutrons it's called tritium and is radioactive. Thank you very much uh wonderful uh people in the uh self service science forum.

 Excellent thank you and you can go along to uh Dr Karl's page as well go through either the Triple J website or the A B C site and uh find Karl's head located on the science page click on it  and uh give us your answers and your questions as well right now we're gunna go to Jason good morning.

 Good morning guys how are youse.

 Good thanks how are you.

 Good  good.

 Now a question for Dr Karl about water.

 Yep. I've got my own um pool maintenance business and we always tend to get these little bugs in the water and I don't know where they're from that whether they're. I've been told they're airborne and then I've been told they they come down with the rain they're borne with the rain.

 Are you talking about the little swimmers that  do a very pronounced breast stroke style.

 That's it yeah boat men I've yeah I've heard h heaps of things for them yeah I just can't and they're hard to kill too.

 And they're but they're good fun to catch if you're a kid  in the swimming pool I used to love catching them in my pool in Queensland . Karl where do they  come from.

 Hang on w what part of the world are you calling from Jason.

 Rocky. Rockhampton.

 Could they be the same sort that you had.

 Absolutely I reckon they are.

 So what happened with you.

 These are they were just always in the pool we had an a above ground swimming pool all these little bugs and they would always be in there 'n' we used to play games to see who could catch the most.

 And how  big are they.

 They're oh  they can get probably a big one no a big one could get up to about a centimetre do you think Jason.

 Yeah yeah  that'd be right yep. And you get these other creatures in there too they're um oh they're huge . .

  Like Loch Ness.

 Yeah  that's it ay. But I  just don't know whether to like y'know with with algae in the pool coming y'know I know that there's algae spores coming down with the rain is that right.

 Yeah the y'get the fungus algae is ih an algae is a mixture  is it of two things a fungus and a lichen no a lichen is a mixture of a f fungus buh uh I I can't remember but th there's one that's a mixture of two others. Now about the insects here's the bottom line. God must have loved insects 'cos he made so many of them . But they're just out there and all they wanna do is have sex  and make more insects. And you got a bit of water mate they'll go there and they'll drink it doesn't matter if it's got a bit of chlorine or not and then they'll have sex and then they'll eat and then  they'll leave more babies and they'll die. They  just do what we do but just a lot faster . Where do they come from it all depends on what you   I don't know whether they live in the trees or in the grass.

 But they I mean they don't seem to have the their leg structure does not seem to be that they could sustain them outside of water.

 No no not at all no no.

 Oh I gotcha. So they  they couldn't actually walk anywhere.

 No.

 Did they.

 No no.

 Did they go from water to water so they need to live in wet areas.

 Yeah .

 Okay so they'd never move inland to into the desert areas.

 No shit no.

 No look I definitely don't know and maybe we need an entomologist to come onto our beautiful homepage go to my clicking head and tell us  and so they they got a how big are these ones a centimetre across.

 A centimetre's a  big one yeah.

 And they do the breast stroke.

 Yeah that's a big one yep. Yeah  but I've got two little. Yeah.

 Okay.

 Yeah but I've seen them I've seen them down south in Brissie and and all that sort of thing I've yeah they're just about in everyone's pool ay.

 Yeah.

 Dow Brisbane is down south.

 um from Rockie yeah  .

 But what what of Melbourne and Hobart they're the end of the e earth I guess from where you are.

 Good on you  Jason well I'd really like to find out about those  bugs as well. So please uh go to the tr to Karl's website and if you've got any answers about those bugs and how the hell they get in your swimming pool good on you mate.

 Alright guys thanks for that see youse.

 No worries  . Ty from Perth good morning.

 How are you doctors.

 Good  Ty> thank you how are you doing.

 Yeah plodding along.

 Excellent.

 Um  just just a quick question about um liquid nitrogen.

 Yeah. 

 Uh it freezes stuff obviously I know that but um I was just wondering if you put that in water like you add a glass of water you put a couple of drops of liquid nitrogen in froze it. Thawed it out could you drink that water.

 Oh yes um it might have a few little bubbles of nitrogen in there captured in between the frozen ice. Um  that'd be perfectly safe because the air that you breath has eighty percent nitrogen in it and in fact if you have perhaps dare I say more money than sense you can in certain wealthy parts of the world I'm talking London New York Los Angeles  buy ice from icebergs from a couple of hundred feet h a couple of hundred metres down. And it's been squashed and squashed the little gas inclusions little bubbles of gas and when you get this bit of ice it's not perfectly clear you put it in your little cocktail and it goes bang bang bang bang bang . So that's what you'd be having if some of the liquid nitrogen.

 So is that it just expanding and melting that  that creates  the banging.

 Yeah the ice has been the the little bubbles have been squashed under pressure  and you relieve the pressure and they just sorta go bang I wanna get outta here. So you might have something like that happening and by the way liquid nitrogen is actually cheaper than milk. Uh on a yeah dollar  per litre basis.

 And it is okay to ingest.

 Well you're breathing it in eighty percent of what you breath is nitrogen.

 Mm but in liquid form it'd be the same .

 Well dih dih liquid form hair c no liquid nitrogen is very dangerous and you put the old yeah the experiment of putting the ora orange in the liquid nitrogen and then you s it just freezes  and you smash it and it's just all splinters .  but but if if you use the liquid nitrogen as a cooling agent to cool ice then the ice itself would be okay.

 'Cos I think uh they used that uh special effects in uh Terminator Two where they  they used it  to uh freeze the cyborg and he shattered it was very exciting.

 Ah that was  so good .

  we've got a dinghy out the back of our place and when we have parties we fill that up put a bunch of dry ice in there and really make it cold y'know it's instantly.

 Yeah.

 Instead of having to by ice 'n' I was wondering if you could do the same with liquid nitrogen just put a few drops in make it sort of uh almost freeze fr uh c cool all the drinks and y'know you're happy.

 Yeah that would work except it's just hard to get a hold of I reckon the dry ice is okay the only trouble with the dry ice  is if you're camping with it 'cos many people use it have two eskies one esky full of dry ice which is used to make bottles of frozen water and the frozen water then is in the other esky which keeps your food cold if you're in a hollow as the dry ice turns into carbon dioxide you could choke to death.

 Ah .

 But apart from that minor problem  no big deal   no big.

 There you go Ty you satisfied.

 Thank you very much.

 Thank you.

 Excellent good on you mate have a good day now  Priscilla.

 Hey look I gotta say it this is the first time I've ever heard anybody call Brisbane as down South . Have you ever heard that.

 Well I lived in Cairns for four years so yes.

 Yeah so you would've called Brisbane down  I mean Queensland is bigger  than eastern Europe. L like all of western Europe you could fit England and  uh France and Germany and all those other countries in there so it's huge.

 So there's an awful lotta people who are north of Brisbane who refer to it as south.

 D down south uh  yeah okay this is good I'm learning  more every day ih cuh sorry uh  Priscilla sorry.

 From Melbourne how you doing Priscilla .

 Alright how are you.

 Good thank you.

 Good. Yeah I have a question for Karl I think he said a little while ago on this show like maybe a year or two  that water was the most corrosive  thing on the planet. And I wondered maybe I want some more information about that is it naturally occurring 'cos I'm thinking acid sounds like it's more corrosive  than water.

 Well uh hydrofluoric acid  is so corrosive that it dissolves in glass. It dissolves glass.

 Right.

 And so you have to have bottles of glass which are lined with beeswax. And the beeswax stops so so hydrof.

 So it can it corrode glass  but not beeswax.

 Ih wuh isn't that weird.

 That is very odd.

 That is weird. So um water can be very corrosive if you crank it up to high temperatures if I said it was the most corrosive stuff known I must've been wrong although if you add salt to it it'll eat through aluminium.

 Yeah.

 Um nyuhzyuh.

 What about naturally occurring.

 Well while.

 Corrodes a lot of coastlines I guess.

 Yeah well it ur that's erosion isn't it.

 Yeah.

 Uh water is very powerful because you can see if you go ever go to the Bungle Bungle um notice I didn't say Bungle Bungles just proving I've been there  up in the top left hand corner of Australia in the area called the Kimberley not Kimberleys y'know why they call it the Kimberley.

 Why.

 'Cos there are a bunch of geologists wandering through there and they said look at those mountains look at this landscape doesn't it look like the Kimberley  back in South Africa brackets where there are lots of diamonds let's keep walking guys . And they kept on walking and then later they found all the diamonds another buncha geologists found the diamonds there. So if you go to the Bungle  so you go the Bungle Bungle which is this area may uh maybe what fifty square kilometres across you can g uh g take a helicopter flight is it maybe fifty Ks off the main road around Australia and yet they were not known to the general populace  until around nineteen-eighty. Takes about three hours to do that fifty Ks 'cos it's really slow and bumpy. And there are these huge mounds maybe two-hundred metres high about three-hundred-four-hundred metres across  and then there are these hard stone river bases which are completely dry. And in the wet season the water goes through there at one cubic kilometre per hour and the hard rock l looks as though a giant hand of God has come down and run through  molten butter and just r uh y'know so so the water has left these huge gouges in the rock. And so water can be very erosive if you get enough of it and one cubic kilometre per hour is a heck of a lot of water.

 Absolutely.

 So y uh water's very powerful stuff um as I'm learning by reading this book by Philip Ball. But it's not the m necessarily the most corrosive 'cos I'd say that hydrofluoric acid is more.

 Yeah .

 Yeah .

 There you Priscilla that's uh probably been rattling around in your head for a while so  now we've come the conclusion acid is more corrosive than water.

 Excellent.

 Good on you luh.

 Thank you very much.

 Let's take a uh track right now from uh Laura Veirs on Triple J this one's called The Cloud Room. We'll be back with Dr Karl after this on Triple J.



 On Triple J that's Laura Veirs and a track called The Cloud Room the album's called Carbon Glacier appropriate today we are talking about water with Dr Karl this morning  and uh you got any you got anything come up  there that you wanna mention.

 Caroline has sent across some pictures of uh water boatmen.

 The little swimmers that you get in your pool that we at least know you get in your pool in Queensland anyway.

 Yeah up no uh in up north or uh could be down south and um unfortunately Mel said ooh I haven't seen them that big they're rather disturbing.

  'Cos I used to catch them in the swimming pool all the time and throw them in my sister's hair .

 And everybody who's emailed in Deb Hedges Philip Hitchcock  they're called water boatmen  and um one is that their eggs are probably carried on birds from other water to your pool and Leon  and Fordy say the insects are anisops A N I S O P S and the reason they float is due to an air sack in the abdomen.

 Ah crafty  little things aren't they.

 Crafty and and people keep on saying water boatmen Mark Dave Gavin everybody says water boatmen vautemotem water boatmen okay they're water boatmen we ag gree they're water boatmen

 And possibly come from birds that's how they  possibly get into your swimming pool.

 Only one person said that.

 No it's a good theory  birds do uh spread a lotta things around. But uh let's get into another question right now Gonk from Bendigo good morning.

 G'day

 Now you've been waiting patiently what would you like to ask Dr Karl this morning.

 I'd like to find out why it is exactly that seawater's salty.

 Mm

 Um when you have the sun shining on the land and the sea it heats it up  the water on the sea evaporates goes up form clouds falls on a land round and round it goes. It's just the pure water that goes up the salt is left behind. So any salt that ever gets into the sea stays there. The water goes around and around  but the salt stays behind there's no mechanism to take the salt out of circulation. Now the you know about the tectonic plate theory drifting continents.

 Indeed I do.

 Yep um they've left behind marks on the ocean floor. Which is called the mid oceanic ridge.

 Mhm.

 Which  is where the continents pull apart from and it looks like the seam on a giant tennis ball . Winding around the earth. And where the continents pull apart  the crust is very thin and at certain points there are places where hot water spurts up. When I say hot I mean like four hundred degrees C that's hot enough to boil except for the fact that it can't boil because there's  three kilometres of ocean above it acting like a giant pressure cooker and this water is black with minerals . Sometimes iron sometimes magnesium all sorts of different salts and this is thought of to explain the theory why you've got a place like Broken Hill or Mt Isa . Like you take off from  sort of y'know Byron Bay and you go west west west y'know you keep going west the landscape changes and suddenly bingo you're at Broken Hill  and you've got this largest deposit largest purest deposit of silver lead zinc virtually ever discovered. And then you turn right and then head up into Queensland turn right and back a bit  and you end up at Mt Isa huge deposits of these minerals how come you just got these little  clumps maybe twenty kilometres across and surrounded by nothing and they think that originally it was way under the ocean and and these minerals got dumped from the crust into the water on the ocean floor when it was three kilometres down and that's where the that's where there's some of the extra salts come from. And the other thing of course is if you've got salt on land  it gets washed into the ocean by the rain from the land onto the rivulets into the rivers into the bays and into the ocean. So once all it's like a cockroach home. Once they go once the salt goes in it never comes out.

 Mm.

 Excellent.

 Ah nice. Good on you Gonk.

 Thank you very much.

 No  worries . So uh this so these massive salt lakes because uh when I lived in the Kambalda which is about forty Ks south of Kalgoorlie huge salt lakes that just span kilometres it's actually where on these salt lakes so flat that they do the land speed records . And things like that so they were once water . That evaporated and now  it's the salt remains.

 That's oh wow so you've actually been on a salt lake.

 Yes I stood on a salt lake it's a very very bizarre thing and blinding I've gotta say you're in the middle of the desert and it's just so white as far as the eye can see.

 There's a medical disease associated with that. With men wearing shorts. It's called shrivelled nuts.

  In technical  terms of course.

 No that's what it's called in the medical journals. And  you actually have men with sunburnt testicles.

 Right from their stubbies with  a bit of uh gappage in them.

 With a bit of gap. Uh uh  gappage I've never never heard that word I've heard of cleavage I've never heard of gappage . Gappage  love it.
 Now Dr Karl uh Zack's actually dropped off the line but I thought we should go to his question  'cos I'm sure it's something that a lot of people have pondered before we go to a track. Zack rang up to say to ask why is it that when drinking beer you get so dehydrated despite the fact that it contains so much water.

 In  if you're having the first glass of beer and the second glass it'll change by the time you get to the twentieth glass of beer. But  when you're drinking we'll we'll say a stubby what's what's that is that what um three-hundred-and-seventy fy  three-seventy-five mils. Right and it's five percent alcohol so five grams in a hundred call it four hundred five by four is twenty grams of alcohol. So you're drinking say three-hundred-and-fifty grams of water and you're drinking twenty grams of alcohol. The effect of the alcohol is to drag out of your system say five or six hundred grams of water. So you absorb the three-hundred-and-fifty grams of water. Y'know which is the other stuff around the beer. But then the alcohol the small amount the twenty grams  is sucking out more. And so it it acts as a dehydrating agent.

 Right and of course you urinate a lot more because you're  drinking a lot more  than you normally would 'n'.

 Um goes uh from your blood  into the kidneys the kidneys are filtering around four-hundred-three-hundred kilograms of blood every day  and pulling out lots and lots of water. And so they they force the kidneys into overdrive  and that's where the diuretic effect happens and so your bladder starts filling up more rapidly.

 Right okay not very intelligent way to put a drink together is it.

 Ah yeah but  look Benjamin Franklin said God invented beer  because he wanted to show that he loved us.

  Dr Karl thank you so much for uh coming on the program this morning what are we talking about next week.

 Um I think we guh should go for the future .  the brains trust has come up with.

 Ooh okay.

 And any topics that the audience would like to discuss we'd be most ever so grateful to hear from you.

 Please let us know by going to the website Triple J dot A B C dot net dot A U or of course you can email me Mel at Triple J dot A B C dot net dot A U thank you so much Karl . Have a lovely week. Here's the Mess Hall here on Triple J it's eight away from twelve.
"
" Uh blue-tongues'd be  unlikely to eat them because the good old uh Hemidactylus the Asian house gecko  ih tends to stick to walls and blue-tongues aren't real good on walking on the side of houses.

 Okay so they can't get them to eat them.

 No um the the biggest predator I would imagine and I d I don't I know of no studies done but n knowing the the way the Australian fauna works in in houses  um I would say the Asian house gecko's biggest predator would be the brown tree snake which is a big gecko feeder . Um but unfortunately the brown tree snake doesn't seem to be able to exist in the broad the broad sort of um uh really seriously altered habitats like the green tree snake like the brown tree snake out in the leafiest suburbs The Gap Toowong out there toward um  Brisbane Forest Park areas are Pullinvale uh Brookfield that sort of thing but the green whu the whereas the green tree snake lives all over I don't think the green tree snake bothers much with geckos but to answer Gary's question. There's a study that's been conducted in the Northern Territory which shows that the Asian house gecko has in fact got into the natural bushland areas in the Northern Territory  and and may well be taking over pushing uh native species around. Um no extinctions have been recorded even locally. Here and south of Brisbane the assumption is that they probably won't do that and that they are house dependent because they're essentially a tropical animal and we're  getting out of the tropics . We're getting to the margins of y'know beyond the margins of where they would normally live in their own um in their own uh original distribution so it may not be detrimental y'know south of the tropics but it may be north of the tropics and that's a study that's ongoing now in the Northern Territory.

 Okay so the the  the jury is still formally  out.

 We yeah we're not yet worried about them in south-east Queensland or or in the southern part of Queensland anyway probably Townsville south mm.

 Okay then let's go the phones Mr  d Nattrass at seven minutes past three Graham from Tarragindi's first up hi Graham.

 Hi Kelly how are you.

 Good good how can we help.

 Rick um the ringneck uh mallee ringneck you uh sighted any in Brisbane area at all.

 Oh yeah.

 Yeah I saw one a couple of weeks ago and I got a hell of a shock 'cos I'd seen them in Western Australia. But uh never here in Brisbane.

 You sure it was a mallee ringneck.

 Well when I look at .

 What colour was the head.

 It was a blacky blue.

 Ah no. See the mallee ringneck um the top of the head there I think is more like a uh greeny blue um you the two black headed ringnecks are the port lincoln and the twenty-eight. Now they're commonly seen around Brisbane  um because s the whoever was actually cleaning the cage and changing the seed and the water left the door open and the bird went out of the aviary.

 Okay because yeah according to Simpson and Day they're not supposed to be here are they.

 Yeah well I was I was um involved with NatureSearch for about um ten years in the Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and the most often recorded non-native in these parts were the two ringnecks. The twenty-eight and um the port lincoln and they are aviary escapees.

 Okay there we go thanks for that Graham on the S M S from Cathy at Mudgeerabah Rick had a tiny bug on the glass sliding door the other night and its bum was glowing. What was it.

 A beetle . And they're uh known as  um fireflies despite the fact that they are beetles. And they have a little system in the tips of the abdomen in segments eight nine and ten I think it is um a battery system and a um u ha gha  lead crystal display unit and they can actually  boot it up and electrically they pulse out this um this glow . And they yep and they signal and it's the um  now let's see.

  that common. Around that area . Or even in Queensland.

 They actually are but I tell you what I once wanted to do  firefly tours I wanted to actually take  people in the evenings and do a flying fox fly out and then take them fireflies and I was talking to the gurus of beetles at the Queensland Museum to find out whether I could really reliably uh predict so that y'know I could plan the thing. And no even though they're widespread they're very common if you get around instead of watching television if you get around good quality bushland in from spring onwards through  summer  uh move around to different spots you know every every week mm spend one night out. Uh just for a few hours after sundown. You will see them at some stage. But where they actually hatch and operate is really up and down it's not very predictable.

 Okay good question Cathy from Mudgeerabah  uh Len from the Sunshine Coast hi Len.

 Hi Kelly.

 Hello tell us about your maggie.

 Uh got a magpie with a bit of um bit of a problem with one of his legs.

 Yep.

 Yeah uh like I'd class it as our ankle and I noticed yesterday he's got a piece of thread which appears to have been looped around it. He's got a horrible limp.

 Yeah.

 Uh.

 Much we  can do about that  Nick.

 Yeah dih.

 Should I try and catch him.

 Yeah yeah do you feed him.

 Yes.

 Good on you. Okay now the trick here is very simply what I would do is I would ring the Maroochydore I think it is or the Cotton Tree office of Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service and let them know you're doing this because if a neighbour sees you setting a trap for a native bird y'know it can cause all sorts of ructions let them know that you've got a bird with a tangled foot and you're gunna attempt to catch it and free it up which they will only be delighted to hear you say 'cos I know there are lots of these casualties out there and not enough rangers . And what you simply do is feed it in the one spot for a couple of days and set up a simple drop trap which is a light box six inches deep made out of timber with shade cloth on the top propped up at an angle of forty-five degrees with a stick with a string back from there throw the meat underneath when your target bird goes in give it a tweak  c cruh clunk down comes the box on the bird  um if you miss the bird.

 Try again.

 The buh well if you miss  he ih he is gunna be very very wary and you give it away for that day and start again tomorrow. 'Cos I've done all this. Um when you do when the box goes down and your bird is under there immediately throw a blanket over the whole lot suh so put it in the dark and that'll reduce all the stress  and then the trick is to drag that  box onto a pi sheet of plywood or something rigid and get the whole thing into the garage because if you lift it up you go in there to catch the bird and it gets out you'll never catch it again well not for a week anyway . Okay.

 True true.

 So you can do it it can be done I've done it it's just a matter of patience and once you've got him inside it's a two person job if you've a a assistance somebody to hold beak somebody to put some cotton wall balls into those feet 'cos if they  if the claws the bird'll be frightened and if the claw even though it knows you if the claws get into your hands it's a fairly painful experience and then just simply with a razor blade or whatever pull the thread off and immediately let the bird go.

 Yeah it appears to be quite swollen too so it may be tightened around  that ankle area.

 Okay well if it looks as if there's some sort of permanent damage then bung the bird into a box and whip it round to your local vet and just get the vet to have a look and it may well be that it's going to recover. Um if the damage is permanent there's not gunna be treatment anyway are you with me.

 No true  true.

 Okay  and I've seen birds who've lost their feet to these things and they still function .

 Ah fair enough.

 But but please do catch him and relieve him of that 'cos it's  just so nasty .

 That's okay.

 And and Len it uh it's worth noting at this point too that uh the captain of Collingwood the Magpies' Nathan Buckley has a hamstring injury also . How ironic. How uh . So if you could  put him in a cage and throw a blanket on him for season two-thousand-and-five I'd appreciate that too.

 Alright.

 Thank you .

 Now  I had a question on butcherbirds.

 Wh.

 Oh s yes quick  butcherbird question go ahead.

 Yeah uh we had like a parent bird two say two-thousand-and-four and two-thousand-and-three babies. Then all of a sudden we have another parent bird with say another two two-thousand-and-four babies and another two or three two-thousand-and-three babies. Where would they have come from.

 Oh you're observing these butcherbirds in only a tiny wah um o only a tiny patch of where they actually live overall you with me.

 Yes.

 So unless you were to band all of the are they puh pied butcherbirds.

 Yeah the black and white ones.

 Yeah. Uh if you were to band them all and then follow them around and get an idea of where their wuh the space that they're all occupying you'll find that it's thirty or forty times the size of your backyard.

 Uh we're on acreage yeah . I I was just wondering if they'd started to hand out menus or something that y'know this guy wants  to give them a good feed.

 No no no see if you read up on the um on the life history of butcherbirds they're a bit like kookaburras in that there are youngsters from previous nestings that don't actually get tipped out immediately at the end of the breeding season like a lotta birds do. They stay on and become helpers for following seasons. But what they get up to um y'know all year round for those couple of years that they're with mum and dad  uh I don't know but I suspect that they're not totally faithful to the nest site and to the parents they show up when times are good and then they help out when times are good and they're in the process of actually looking to get outta that territory and do their own thing.

 Mm Len thank you very much we've just got a few more calls to get to. Six-twelve A B C Brisbane and A B C Local Radio Queensland it's twenty minutes past three Ric Nattrass is with us as he is every Monday after the three o'clock news let's go to Cathy from Tolga Cathy hello.

 Hi Kelly hi Ric. Um  we've got an acre surrounded by a paddock planted little rainforest patch down the back a few years ago and great excitement a catbird's moved in.

 Beautiful.

 He starts calling in the morning that awful squawking call. 

 Mreeaar .

 Yeah yeah and but he is replying to himself also with a tweety sort of sound.

 Yes they do yeah there's more than that call yep.

 Is he just on his own.

 I dunno I'm down h .

 Well we've looked and we can only see him  he's making  all the noise.

 Yeah it yeah it's it's likely to be it's likely to be a male a young male who's found a new patch and and looks like setting up home  and is it's the greenish one.

 It is.

 Yeah okay so your yours up there is the spotted catbird if you're on  the Atherton Tableland  ours down here is the green. Um and those  w whistle calls and things are all part of the call that you you you rarely hear unless you're up close  and what I will tell you  was that this happens in my family and my father in law is the catbird guru . Um they love grapes.

 Grapes.

 Yeah.

 Okay .

 Oh nice to know.

 So is he gunna make his little display down there during the season or will he hang around.

 They once they go into reproductive mode Cathy they are fiendishly difficult to observe  so you're gunna have a lot of fun when he's close to the house and if you put a little tray of grapes out he'll love you. That's when you're gunna see him when it gets all reproductive it gets all private.

 Right yeah we hear them in the rainforest when we're walking but very rarely see them so.

 Correct yeah.

 We're a bit excited about this one.

 Yeah  absolutely yeah yeah okay.

 Thanks Cathy.

 Okay thank you.

 Pleasure.

 Bye.

 Margaret from River Hills hello.

 Oh good afternoon Kelly and Ric um I have a a crow near m my place that thinks it's a magpie when I'm out wur walking early in the morning it bombs me is this normal or . Do I have to change my track or.

 Well just put your umbrella over your head . But it's not unusual for crows um y'know the the magpie is famous  for b um y'know the disturbed one swooping on people during its breeding season but believe me the it's n by no means exclusive. I've been dusted up by  noisy friar-birds because I was feeding a baby koel that they thought was theirs and wanted it back I've been dusted up by spangled drongos pied currawongs grey and black uh grey and pied butcherbirds noisy mynas and the piece de resistance of having your ears ripped off is the peregrine falcon if you get too close  to the nesting ledge and it's a bird uh w when you have a really good look at it it's the one you don't want dusting you up.

 Good I'll change my walking .

 But look no just just put your umbrella over your head  when the bird swoops stand absolutely stock still  and remain where you are because the bird will then say to itself hang on it's supposed to run away. And when it doesn't ih within a couple of days it'll stop the behaviour because what it does is it gets a threat back from you that eh it's supposed to run away it's not running away my god I better stop doing that and that's what they do.

 Okay there you go Margaret some words of advice there. Hayden from Townsville hi Hayden.

 Hi Kelly how are you.

 Good good now tell us about this carpet python.

 Yeah well Ric last week I think you were talking about the colourations on carpet pythons and uh I was coming down a hill on a my mountain bike one day and um this is a couple of years ago out behind Townsville in the Mt Stewart Road and I came across a I presume it was a carpet python but it was bright yellow and black. Really distinct markings and I I've never seen one in a book like that and I've I've attended snake identification courses I've never seen anything quite like it but  last week.

 Yeah dur he was talking about um you were talking about bright yellow ones last week Ric.

 No yeah that was  a different that was a slightly different f different one um Hayden the the carpet python has occasional individuals which are absolutely outrageously stunning. And in my book Talking Wildlife which um is out now there's a photograph there taken by Paul Grimshaw at Mt Crosby on the outskirts of Brisbane of a carpet python which is very very spectacular and unlike your standard job. That's what you've seen there there are just occasional individuals that are incredibly brilliantly coloured like gold and purple.

 Yes.

 Yeah.

 Yes.

 Yep yep.

 Yeah absolutely spec and and like at least I would say three metres long a really big   solid looking python.

 Yeah yeah and also um those really dark colours can be when the carpet python is about to do a shed and when uh after it's just before it milks up um they'll get th the whole outside'll get very very dark and that can change colours as well so they're not the same colour all year round. Yep.

 Oh thanks for that Hayden six-twelve A B C Brisbane and A B C Local Radio Queensland twenty-five minutes past three this is Wildlife Talkback. Uh next up Alan from Townsville hi Alan.

 Oh hi juh uh Kelly and Ric. Uh Ric um we've got as usual a lot of geckos in the house or outside the house and uh I presume there's some noisy mala Malay or Asian ones and uh some of the ordinary ones there're some are a pale lightish colour and smooth and others are a bit uh rugged looking brown and also some of them are cannibals they eat any baby geckos that are around. I got two question I was wondering if I can identify which is which of them and if it's the males or the females only that eat the babies uh some of them we've noticed will hunt with the baby geckos but others will hunt the geckos .

 Yeah.

 Uh could you uh give us any idea there.

 I think in that magnificent book um by the uh uh published by the Queensland Museum and it's called Wildlife of Tropical North Queensland  which you should be able to get you will be able to get in fact from the museum shop I think there is a branch of the Queensland Museum in Townsville is there not.

 Uh there's a museum here Ric I'm not sure.

 Yeah have a have a look in the phone book for Queensland Museum in  Townsville. Pop in there there is a book called Wildlife of Tropical North Queensland. It has all the gecko species in there.

 Oh yes.

 Now having said that they're highly variable a lotta the species and pretty difficult to sort out  um if you were to um y'know find a deceased one or something the the only way that you can really be positive about its identification is run through some very complicated keys in a book called um Reptiles and Amphibians of Australia by H G Cogger but also I'm pretty certain that there is a branch of the Queensland Museum up there they will be able to help you with your identifications anyway.

 And do they mix uh Ric do they mate.

 No no no there are there are set species and there's no hybridisation in the Asian house gecko and ours nor any hybridisation that I know of in our own species  and in the Townsville area there's likely to be around about um eight to ten species I would say roughly we've got about six or eight in in the Brisbane area I'd say you'd have eight to ten um and of those about four or five will be wall climbers.

 Okay then now that book you mentioned Reptiles and Amphibians  of Australia by whom.

 Yeah it uh H G Cogger but that's for the y'know the real nerds  oh that's it's a nerd it's a y'know it's a well over  a hundred dollars and it's  and it's a nerdy book and you've gotta go through these very complicated keys. The trick is with geckos is to get Wildlife of of either Greater Brisbane for the southern part or um Tropical North Queensland for the northern part have a look at the pickies and see if you can sort them out from there other than that it's a specialist job actually.

 Okay now Sharon from Dalby wants to tell us about her her birds hi Sharon.

 Hi how are you  um I was interested um buh to hear Ric talk about feeding a koel before. Um last season we started to feed a couple of koels and of course they went away to wherever they go Indonesia or noh up north.

 P N G yep.

 Yep and then this year the two of them arrived back again now um and they come usually with the magpies but what I noticed was that um the female was taking food away one day and I thought oh I wonder if she's taking it to a baby but no she was feeding the male up in the tree and then.

 Eh.

 Yeah. It was the male and then  ih and then after that the male came down one day and he did the same thing and he was feeding her and I I just thought that was most unusual and um they they come down around about the same time as the maggies and the other day the female the maggies were there and the female  sort of threatened one of the maggies and when they when she was she sort of hisses and her neck comes up like a.

 Yeah chook.

 Yeah.

 Yeah mm.

 Yeah  and I'd I'd never seen it before and um y'know I thought it was just amazing that they came back to the exact same spot .

 No I could tell you something Sharon that the banded birds that we've observed from the Brisbane area that have been hand raised orphans and banded and then allowed to do their normal migration have plonked back in the very same yard that they took off from and I'm talking > twenty perch blocks.

 That's amazing.

 They have landed in exactly the same spot started calling when they've arrived back  you go out and have a look and there's the band on the leg .
"
" If you haven't been with us before this how it functions Jurate Sasnaitis joins us every couple of weeks and every month for our book club good afternoon Jurate.

 Good afternoon Lynne.

  It's like being at school. And we talk about a book which is just like every other book club and I really just started this because I wanted to be in a book club and  nobody would ask me so I thought I'd start my own.

 And so yes.

 Wo we run.

 We ask everybody . Bit like Marilyn Monroe isn't it we want everybody to .

 To like us  love us yes. The Lovely Bones you loved and I didn't really.

 Oh look it's so funny isn't it  did you want to tell that story like how much Jurate hated this book and so let's do it for book club . And then Jurate changed her mind.

 And Lynne takes an opposite view  so we will explore all this in its fascinating complexity. Alright Jurate you give us the plot what happens in The Lovely Bones.

 Well The Lovely Bones basically is narrated by Susie Salmon like the fish  who's. As she says yes I didn't make that up and she's a fourteen year old and within the first few lines of the book we discover that she was raped and murdered in nineteen-seventy-three. Now she is in a place called heaven which she later discovers is kind of a bit like limbo actually it's not quite heaven heaven it is for people or souls rather who still cling to life on earth so what um Susie does from heaven from her vantage point of heaven is to observe in the next eight years as the plot goes on what happens to her family her mother father very young much younger brother and young sister the policeman mainly involved in her case and of course her murderer. So we get to see how all these people cope with the aftermath of a really horrid violent tragic event in their lives and how they grow uh cuh each very individually and very differently cope with grief . And that's the bare bones.

 Yes as opposed to The Lovely Bones  now yes we should point out that you didn't like it when you first read it  a couple of years ago.

 But I suspect it's for the same reasons you didn't like it this time.

 Which are.

 Well for me I thought it was the most offensively saccharine vision of heaven I had ever read  what do you reckon.

 Well you thought that because ih uh in Susie Salmon's heaven everybody determines their own heaven if you like.

 Yes and you have the people that you want to encounter or they want to encounter you in their heaven and ih it looks like um somewhere that you I suppose feel safe and  and happy and comfortable. So if you're young if you're a fourteen year old in Susie's case it's her local high school but there are no teachers you know there are plenty of dogs playing around she manages to conjure her um life her gar well her death guide I suppose you'd say who's an older woman  she realises like a mother figure angel. Um she f gets a friend they have slightly different versions but you know come together in the same version I mean it made me feel a bit sick the first time I read it I thought this is wrong this is.

 Why why did you think that bit was so wrong.

 Well   just felt American to me actually.

 Yes well it was it was   a fourteen year old high school vision yes of heaven. But uh I suppose  that was a little twee for me but.

 Twee.

 Twee is right yes yes. But that's not the thing that I found most annoying.

 Come on tell me.

 No let's take some calls  Rick Rick's in Mccrae good afternoon Rick.

 Hello this is Rick here.

 Hi you loved it.

 I did I had a fantastic time reading about a number I've I've listened you I'm a talking book and I've listened to it several times and it gets better every time.

 And and was there anything specific that really stuck with you from it Rick.

 There ih there um one thing I I felt that uh 'cos I don't want to spoil it for people have uh haven't read it is but um I like the way that uh the murderer had uh um came to grief in the end.

 That was  excellent.

 In the very end. And I like the way he did that happen to him and I thought good.

 Yeah he's been dispatched.

 Yeah exactly.

 Yeah good point Rick he does come to um uh an appropriate termination twenty-three past two hi Sarah.

 Uh good afternoon. I loved it I I didn't find the heaven saccharine I'd I didn't think she was that happy there anyway.

 Didn't you.

 Well I didn't.

 She was a bit frustrated  'cos she wanted to be on earth didn't she.

 Yeah yeah.

 She was bored.

 Yeah she was bored so that's why I didn't think it was saccharine.

 I know uh well Sarah if I can just interrupt  sorry but I must say that it's interesting because a couple of years ago when I first read it I had all those reactions and thought it was too much and really icky and this time I didn't think so at all. So I think it so much depends doesn't it where  you are  when you read something and what expectations you have of the plot as well and must say this time I actually thought contextually it fitted very well and I didn't find it over sort of sweet either. I think I must have been in a very particular mood a while ago.

  Couple of years ago when you first read it.

 Yeah  what else Sarah.

 Uh  I was going to say I'd ih I couldn't put it down for a start I was read I can't normally read in the car but I was reading it you know as a passenger of course.

 Oh I was gunna say .

 It was just one of those that kept me up late at night 'cos I didn't want to stop reading.

 Right.

 And once I'd got through the uh awful bits.

 Yes.

 The gory bits.

 And they are pretty grim.

 Yeah it was pretty hard to get through that  but I'd it just left me with an overall sense of  um this sounds saccharine but beauty I just I had  tears running down my face when I finished .

 Oh nice.

 Yeah.

 I r I did read one uh comment about it saying that ih ih was it was full of grace which I think is probably fair. And maybe what you mean by beauty in a way Sarah.

 Yes yes.

 Mm.

 That notion of of um   acceptance and uh wise or great wisdom and and tolerance and all those things it does give you hope. Thanks a lot for your comments Sarah very insightful now I'll tell you why I didn't like it shall I.

 Yes tell me.

 It wasn't the heaven bit that that struck me as as ghastly  I didn't find that too bad 'cos I just ih kind of  accepted that fourteen year old Susie Salmon  was just your archetypal American girl so that's how her heaven would look but it bothered me when the plotline pursuing Mr Harvey  her murder and rapist fell away.

 Ah.

 I felt the pace dropped dramatically  at that stage and I struggled to move through it.

 So you would've preferred to find out more about him  and his.

 Yeah and I felt  felt it was sort of half and half and I wondered if Alice Sebold really knew what she wanted there 'cos it struck me that the gear changed it it started out as a pretty page turning crime investigation at the beginning  those y'know bits of clues turning up and  Len Fenerman the the policeman  coming in and out of the story and then it moved into this exploration of grief which in itself was quite valid and interesting but the two sort of sandwiched together to me didn't quite gel.

 But don't you think because it does take place over eight years and naturally an uh I mean obviously Susie could go on to observe other murders  and we do have a character also in the novel called Ruth who is um supposedly psychic and she actually does sense other people who have been raped and murdered mainly women and children and um I mean there are parts of that that I have a little bit of difficulty dih with  . You should see the face Lynne is making um  and but I you know what I really liked about it. Sorry to change the subject but I really liked her observations of daily life.

 Yeah and I would accept that  I think that's good.

 Okay it's flawed ih thih I think it's probably a deeply flawed first novel and m perhaps we should tell the listeners as well I don't know if everyone realises that Alice Sebold was actually raped  herself and in fact the first book she wrote was a book called Lucky and that actually tells about her own experience and she and subsequent trial of the fellow who raped her. Now she calls it Lucky because she of course survived  and she survived without any um gruesome physical you know anything happen well apart from the obvious happening to her but I think the fellow had actually  physically um harmed other women quite violently and badly so in her case she felt very lucky to  to have survived. So I think I mean ih it's interesting I wonder how that has actually influenced this novel.

 Yes.

 But also how much desire there must be to actually makes something good out of such a bad experience.

 Yeah it does give you another   perspective on on the on the novel that's for sure and I'll go on to be boring in my nit picking in just a moment. Liz is in Anglesea hi Liz.

 Hello Lynne. Lynne I'm ringing I have I'm holding it in my hand . My daughter um  recommended it and said it was the best book she's ever read. She's a paediatrician so whether looking at it from a children's point of view.

 Mm.

 I don't know and she said b she started to read it in a plane on her way to a um a conference cried in the plane was a bit embarrassed that she was crying in public and but she said it was best book she ever read so I sent one to my niece in France. Who lives in France and doesn't get a lot of good.

 English  books yeah.

 And uh every time I go to read it because I knew it was about murder I'd I read in night time have no wish to have nightmares   find a daytime to read them.

 Yes .

 But she said it was she r she's a prolific reader. And she said it was the best book she'd ever read.

 Okay Liz  well I'm just trying to think of when you're gunna have a chance to read it that won't um  interrupt your night's sleep.

 I'll watch myself down the beach one day.

 Good.

 Have a read.

 Okay well I hope we don't spoil it for you.

 Oh no no it's fine because she gave me the uh nitty gritty of it but it's interesting because she ih um she's a very um ih wih oh she's a very prolific reader  I have to say has read y'know from classics down to novels all the time. Knocks books over very quickly. Um I just thought it was very interesting the your perspective against against what she'd told me.

 Yes well there are parts of it that I think work really really well and um as as Jurate has has stoutly defended  Alice Sebold I think some of her observations of people and circumstance are really quite extraordinary and I'm sure that has a lot to do with the fact.

 I was wondering if it's to do with the experience.

 Yes  exactly.

 You're a mother of young kids.

 Mm. 

 So's my daughter but her eldest's nine but she works with children and often with children who are abused. So I wonder if that has a perspective in the in her um appraisal of the   too.

 Liz I think the only way to to work that one is for you to read it.

 Oh yes.

 Okay.

  Thanks Lynne.

 Thank you  for your call. It's half past two and we're talking about The Lovely Bones which is our book club book for March by Alice Sebold Jurate Sasnaitis is with us too from Greville Street bookstore. I suppose this half and half thing  is uh came up over and over for me it was half a a murder mystery  uh exploration of grief half and half it seemed to me half of it was in a pretty authentic to me at least sounding fourteen year old voice and then towards the end it becomes all very omniscient and she's terribly wise and she's staring down from heaven and everybody's being terribly accepting and that kind of jarred. And it's h half some really superb as I was talking about with you and Liz insightful reflections on grief and then this sort of magic realism little  excursions every  now and again. And I think mm dunno about that.

 Yeah. It's I think with that sort of writing  you either go with the flow or you don't really . Because if you're going to actually try and figure out like when I was  when with preconception as I was rereading the book I was taking notes originally and say for example once again about this character Ruth who's a psychic I was taking these notes that were like oh why is the artist and poet always the loony one . Y'know why is it that this person has to hold y'know the sort of loony aspects like sh one she's a lesbian two she's kind of psychic and a bit loopy three she runs around dressed like a goth y'know she she's sort of like the only non-middle class if she's the out  she's the obvious outcast . And she also of course is the recipient at the end of a very crucial moment in Susie's development in heaven and on earth but we're not allowed to say 'cos it would spoil everything. Um it's like yes I agree I think those things are really irritating   but  as I was reading it this time I found not quite as irritating as the first time and I thought oh it's actually very interesting this person does actually hold ap a s a sort of special place in the book as well because she is kind of a link  and she does actually step outside normal society and have a look at what's really going on . Whereas everyone else is kind of like in it.

 Yes living it in the moment  she's the observer  that's that's that is true I would have liked to have known more about Ruth I found that a bit tantalising that we sort of get occasional moments of her l living in  New York in a cupboard and  and working as a waitress. Twenty-seven to three Cathy hi.

 Is that me.

 That's you.

 Look I've just read The Lovely Bones and  I do think Alice Sebold has portrayed the effect of a child murder  on a family very well that part of the book I liked but most of her writing irritated me I didn't like it. I certainly don't agree with that um mother of the paediatrician it's certainly not my favourite book . Because um the treatment of Mr Harvey like your Jurate has just said I find that too unreal the the lack of wanting to find Mr Harvey and to and to see him caught and dealt with  that's too nice Susie's too nice in the way she watches Mr Harvey from heaven and uh it's just not real enough in my w .

 You think she'd be angry.

 I think that most people would feel angry.

 Absolutely.

  when you know about  the other serial murders that he's done  and whether it's the fact that you're in America and you can't trace somebody interstate or whatever th that's nothing is put into that  it's almost as if  uh uh I just found that very lacking and I slowed down in the middle of the book.

 I am exactly with you Cathy 'cos that that had bothered me and I wanted that plotline to continue and I couldn't I found it really frustrating that the  search for Mr Harvey just stalled.

 And when he does die in last page virtually um it although a previous caller said that they thought it was a a good ending but I didn't think it was good enough  really.

 That's yes  that's interesting.

 I d I don't think it would be out of turn to say that um finally w we do get a slight sort of epilogue to Mr Harvey he's been out of the plot in all but very occasional and uh passing mentions for most of the second half of the book and then he suddenly gets dispatched  in the last page or so.

 I I I was throughout the book wanted to follow up and find him  because I was feeling outraged and when we did this book in our book club um I heard that Alice Sebold herself had been raped.

 That's right yes.

 Uf and she s wrote it uh stopped her biography which was called Lucky and then wrote this book and then went back to Lucky or the other way round either way um I see that her experiences have come out in the rape of Susie.

 Sure.

 But because Alice wasn't murdered um her fantasy is not is not good enough in my books and I don't like the way she sort of tidies it all up at the end   and that's too too sweet and sh.

 Bit too neat.

 Yes.

 She doesn't stay in heaven looking down in a way she enters people's bodies as if she's uh I mean apart from Ruth she actually goes into her mother's feelings and her father's feelings and the .

 She does watch people's thoughts yeah.

  was fantastic. I really was moved I was really feeling sad at the time when mother leaves Abigail leaves . And I didn't approve of that  safe to say I think the facts just um the effect on the children from the paediatrician's point of view that previous caller  would be terrible  to have a mother leave for eight years.

 Cathy thank you very much for all of that because um there's lots of food for thought in there. Kitty's in Carnegie hi Kitty.

 Oh hi Lynne how you going.

 I'm well you liked it.

 I did I loved it very much  yeah I I'm I'm interested I I actually read it last year on a plane on the way to Paris to um meet up with my husband who was on a conference and it was delightful 'cos I had about  ten solid hours to just enjoy it without interruptions from my three young children so it was just great um.

 That is true  heaven yes   that's what your heaven would look like Kitty.

 Absolutely and um  the one thing I want to say is that um I don't know so much that it was important that this murderer was apprehended and punished and so we could all feel better and sleep better at night I think none of that would have brought Susie back um and I think it was actually quite clever that Alice departed from that avenue and started to look more at the characters and the the loss and the sorrow and all of that . Um I don't think it needed to be all happily stitched up in uh in another way um depends on one's focus I g.

 Yeah fair enough.

 Um but I I thought it was delightful. Yeah.

 Thank you for Kitty I suppose I d I just got captivated in the search and the the  forensics of .

 Oh  we should have read a different book.

 I know I know Bullia hi.

 Hello um  sorry I had to clear my throat.

 That's okay.

 Uh a friend lent me the book a couple of months ago and at first I wasn't very keen on reading it. Once I'd started however I I found it a very interesting concept and a gripping story and I finished it within a couple of days. But one basic vital part the particular bones that were supposedly recovered  seemed totally unrealistic to me and that sort of irritated me all through the book because the elbow  is a junction of y'know some long bones it's not like say a foot or a hand or something that might be a separate thing in itself so had the murderer cut off the forearm and the upper arm first .

 Mm I I think that's what happened.

  are the bones joined by ligaments or what . Which seems totally unrealistic and improbable  and that basic improbability of the particular bones that she c says were found.

 Yes fair enough.

 Was a flaw that irritated me  all through the book.

 Uh and it would be difficult to get away from that irritation once you'd  set upon it  mm. Good point thank you for that The Lovely Bones as they're described on the y'know in the title actually refers to a little passage that comes up late in the book where she describes uh in fact I'll read it for you.



 Mm.

 Which I thought was naff.

 Yes I can see you thought that . Look oh I'm so prepared to go with it in a way I just utterly think it's a feelgood novel despite the grim aspects of it. It is definitely meant to send a positive message. Um we can overcome our grief possibilities are there if we have desire we don't have to give up our memories of the beloved we can hold them to us forever life goes on. I mean it's very nice  I think actually like the first time I read it it was quite soon after my grandmother had died and that's when I found that I was very angry with that book because of course it's not that easy really you know and  so.

 And you do get a sense of that I mean the characters go through all sorts of grief.

 They do  I think  they do.

 One of our callers pointed out Abigail the mother disappears she  goes to the other side of the country and works in a winery and.

 Which sounded quite fun  .

 The marriage breaks down and she has an affair and all sorts of y'know  developments and Buckley I really liked taking your calls on The Lovely Bones for this month's book club Juliet in Clayton thank you for being patient.

 That's alright .

 You loved it.

 I did um I read it about a year ago so I sorta I don't remember all the details but I just liked the fact that well I I got out of it that it really annoyed me how the family fell apart like I think if I was in Susie's position and I could see how unhappy my family were that'd really angry me like I'd want them to be sad for a start and then sorta get on with their lives and be h be happy like I just I don't see suh that something that they did that they couldn't have helped happened but then that wrecked their lives as well. And obvious and her brothers as well . That sorta just really I think I got that out of it so .

 But did it it read  believably that that sort of family breakdown.

 Well yeah I think that  I think that really could happen to someone's  family that if that happened it'd just be terrible.

 Split yeah.

 Y'know they needed to sort of get over it in a way  and and get on with their lives because they couldn't change it and then not it wasn't gunna bring her back so.

 But I suppose the fact that they they can't have a funeral really they have a um a commemorative ceremony but there's  no body found so it's it's actually really difficult for them  in lots of ways to deal with the death and disappearance. Like for so long I think  in fact they don't if she they're hoping against hope that she  isn't dead.

 I guess that'd be really hard I just I just know if I was in her position I'd just really I'd just want my family to be happy and just sor of y'know go on with things .

 Gee I think I'd want my family to be really unhappy for a really  for a really long time.

 Oh no.

 No really like I'd wanna be really missed and I'd want people to have a really hard time .

 Oh no you wouldn't .

 Ah I dunno .

 Oh Juliet you're a very generous soul obviously  thank you for that. Now that that raises a very interesting point and and I think that's that's uh a subtext in the book is  that Susie as a fourteen year old does want to be missed and she is  and she struggles too with letting go of her own family and  sort of having to peer over them all the time to make sure that she's being remembered.

 And never to grow up  as well so those strange sort of watching and not being able to participate I mean  quite ghastly really if you think about it.

 Terribly frustrating nine-four-one-four-one-seven-seven-four or one-eight-hundred-oh-double-three-eight-hundred if you'd like to talk about The Lovely Bones. Susie Salmon dies and goes to heaven and then watches as all the consequences fall out. Melanie's in Brunswick hi.

 Hi how you going.

 Very well.

 Good um I loved the book I'll just start with that but I must admit I was quite um choosy in who I recommended it too  seeing that I was a single female no children and I could remove  myself from the story and from the family but I didn't recommend it to my mother. I did remec I didn't recommend it to a friend who had children I thought uh y you might not be able to remove yourself from that situation.

 Mm that's very sensitive of you Melanie.

   my thought for the day yeah  no yeah I just ih ih like I usually recommend something but this I thought no I yeah  I think I had the advantage of of not being involved or not or being able to remove myself from it I suppose.

 That's really interesting. So ih do you do that with other books or you just thought  to do it with this one.

 No actually I do do it with other books actually there's a Jacqueline Mitchard book a Theory of Relativity I think it was about a child that uh lost both parents and there's like a custody battle. And again it was like there's certain people I'm not going to recommend that book to.

 Mm.

 You could work in a bookshop Melanie.

  I'd love to .

 Uh oh.

 I'd love to so yeah look I ih it I didn't recommend it to a lotta people no.

 But you liked it yourself.

 I did like it myself it did have a lotta flaws as you said and but I did enjoy it lots of lots of crime but the beautiful part was when she saw her dog.

 Yes.

 Running with the other dogs I bawled .

 I'm a dog person   too.

 But yeah I did love it .

 Fair enough  good on you thanks for that  now the dog is a lovely character in the book  his his name is holiday which is just gorgeous in itself and uh the whole notion I suppose of inventing your own heaven I found really a lovely idea a great concept to work with I'd be really interested in what your idea of heaven is if you'd like to share it even if you haven't read the book if you could define your own heaven what would it be I think for one of our callers it was unlimited time alone so you can read  without uh interruptions from small people. Jurate what would your heaven look like.

 I think someone asked me that a few weeks ago when I was first r rereading the book and I just I really don't know. Isn't that terrible it's like I have no concept at all. I cah I really I we were th talking about that old song before we went on air heaven is place on earth  and I think I'm I'm a bit of an earth girl really . I'm a bit of a  y'know if we're gunna get a bit spiritual let's go with the beautiful tropical island the blue seas the golden sands and a beautiful sunset I know it sounds pathetic but really. I love it I love and it's like I think that was in the book as well Susie remembering all those wonderful sensory perceptions the smells that you get even skunk smell she talked about remember and um and the sights and flowers and food and you think yeah it's great it's actually great down here despite everything.

 Mm  Margaret's in Anglesea hello Margaret.

 Hello Lynne.

 What did you make of it.

 Well we read it in our book club here in Anglesea last year or the year before and I could relate to it because in my extended family we've suffered the grief and pain of a child's accidental death  and her sister  really um behaved much the way that Susie's sister did she didn't want to  um be always worrying about Susie's death and she didn't want to be known as the sister of the missing  girl. And I think it's obvious that parents can fall apart because there's so much recrimination after um and so much remorse  after a child's death.

 And guilt even if  you've had nothing to do with  it.

 Mhm and I think uh Susie's sister who's name I can't remember.

 Lindsay.

 What was it .

 Lindsay mm.

 Lindsay really did behave the way some children obviously do  they want to put it out of their minds and say well this happens and therefore I can't do and couldn't do anything about it.

 Yep.

 But I really thought it was um a very interesting concept of just as good as anybody else's concept  of heaven.

 Yes. What would yours look like Margaret.

 Oh heavens oh I dunno .

 That's a perfect response.

 I would be in a garden oh yes oh heaven  that's a good response .

 In a garden.

 In a garden.

 A fragrant garden.

 Oh yes.

 Good.

 Mhm.

 I hope you've got one  in Anglesea.

 Well it's very difficult in Anglesea growing gardens by the sea.

 Yeah this is true . Thank you  for your call.

 We really had a good discussion that was a very good discussion at our book club  of that book.

 And it's been a really good discussion today. Absolutely we've had a couple of calls from people who've had children die and as you can  imagine this is  uh very difficult for for them and they tell it tell us that it is impossible to get over.

 Of course.

 Anything like this and that it can definitely break up families and I  I seem to recall hearing some terrible statistic about people who had had this  happen to them. And the number of of family break-ups I think is  higher much higher than your average because of the incredible stress it puts on all the individual parties and their dealing with their specific manifestations of grief so  thank you to those people who rang to tell us about that and um um best luck best condolences six to three Lisa hi.

 Hi how are you.

 Did you like the book.

 Um I absolutely loved it I read it um it was actually my husband's Christmas present from my mother and I picked it up 'cos I had nothing else to read and I finished it in about two days.

 So your mother gave it to your husband.

 Yeah .

 That's an interesting choice.

 Mm.

 Yeah but um.

 Did he read it too.

 He did but he didn't read it to for quite some time after me but all my friends lined up in the meantime to read it. And most of them thought it was really really good. Mainly because um like we all think about what it's like when you die or  what happens and I just thought that was quite plausible and really nice .

 Very desirable.

 Yes ih y'know there's her grandfather 'n'.

 Mm.

 Yes that's a nice  scene.

 And the dog.

 I thought that was  yeah and the dog that's right and yet yeah it all made sense I thought it was really great.

 And I love that little moment of tension she has which struck me as as just classic fourteen year old response where her father has had the heart attack and he's hovering between life and death and she can't make up her mind what she wants whether or not she wants him to die and come and be with her  or or to live and stay. So.

 At her age I thought she was incredibly mature.

 Yeah that  that sorta maturity bothered me a bit 'cos I didn't  think that was all that.

 And the only other  thing that bothered me was when she sort of inhabited that girl's body.

 Yep.

 I thought hang on.

 Yeah me too.

 Mm  bit icky I thought .

 Yeah and I thought I thought that it just lost a little bit of credibility there but yeah uh overall it was fantastic.

 Fair enough good on you Lisa thank you for that Robyn joins us from Footscray hi Robyn.

 Hi um I read the book quite a while ago and I got a bit angry and I think I dunno whether I've got it right or not but they could never catch that man they got so close to him.

 Mm.

 But the police did couldn't seem to work out who it was.

 That's right until he'd pushed off and left the town  and went  without trace.

 And I I y'know I got I got a bit annoyed about that I wanted to be c I wanted him to be caught.

 Yes me too.

 Yeah  .

 I wanted vengeance.

 Pardon.

 I wanted some vengeance.

 Yes  yes but um it was a really good book yeah.

 Good  thanks for your call and we'll go to Mary who joins us from Geelong hi Mary.

 Hi thank you for the discussion it has been really fascinating because I love the book. And my daughter also loved the book  but I just want to say the bit about heaven my mother in law used to say to me that heaven couldn't be it wouldn't be heaven if you knew what was going on on earth. You would suffer  so terribly to see the mistakes  and bungles and troubles your family got into so she said there must be some way where where you just don't know what's happening you're in another place altogether.

 Yes.

 Oh that's I think that's very .

 Very powerful.

  very I don't think her hah her heaven in the book was a happy place at all it  seemed to have to me a a feeling of greyness. To have.

 I think she had to move on from that particular that was an interim  limbo and.

 So I suppose it was a bit like purgatory.

 Mm yes a waiting in room.

 You wouldn't happen to know if she's writing another book or has.

 I suspect she would be writing one but there's certainly no news yet as to what that might be or when it might be coming out.

 Because often you read a book that you really do love and then you never hear of the writer again I'm thinking of like I Heard the Owl Call My Name which I thought was one of the best books I've ever read but I've never heard that Margaret Craven wrote anything else.

 I'd have to find out for you I'm sorry  Mary . Sorry.

 Thank you. Thanks for that.

 Thank you for your call. That's very true that it would be enormously difficult to watch your loved ones .

 Yes I think  that was a wonderful  sort of observation.

 Mm  and I suppose that underscores the whole notion of the book that she did have to go through this point of letting go and for her family to do that too on earth and that makes a lot of sense to me . That that's how it would be.

 Absolutely. I guess it just m it did actually wrap it up very  very neatly  and perhaps the relationship with the mother and father you know really if your wife had left for eight years perhaps you'd be a little angrier when she came back . You know things like that but.

 Yes and he was he was totally devoted   the husband . Let's talk about next month's book.

 Oh goody.

 Just in passing  The Great Gatsby from F Scott Fitzgerald. Shouldn't be too hard to get hold of  at all. And

 Everywhere.

 Everywhere in all the libraries and it's only about a hundred-and oh fifty odd pages so it's not gunna take you long and you've probably read it before anyway so it's just a refresher course between.

 And wonderful films.

 Here in April ih great films.

 Three versions.

 Are there three  I could only think of two.

 There's the Alan Ladd version  and then we've got the Mia Farrow version  and then there's actually I think it's um is it Minnie Driver.

 Yeah.

 She I think it's her there's a quite uh I think they probably made it for television there's a contemporary version or anyway nineties nineteen-nineties version.

 So  visit the video store.

 I suspect so yeah.

 And it's also on a very good audio book which I'm  pretty confident would be available at the A B C shop so if you'd like to hear it and or read it there are all your options Jurate thank you very much.

 Thank you excellent discussion.

 It was great.

 Yeah.
"
" Ah look l Les Pete.

 I  uh  I I've I've brought in um the um repair of Simon's ren renovated shelf.

 Oh have you brought it in.

 Yes I have. There you are Simon .

 Hang on a sec hang on a hang on a sec this is this is 'cos uh those who are just joining us who might be back from holidays or something like that  I uh tried a little bit of home renovation when the um over the over the Christmas break and I had a piece of square wood and I used one of those jigsaws.

 I thought you used your teeth.

 Well yes it was my God look at that.

 There you are Simon .

 That is beautiful.

 There you are th you can now screw it up on the wall.

 That is well and truly polishing a  bad job  that I did isn't it.

 No no it's not it's it's making a silk purse.

 And that nick that's out of the corner is where you'd cut .

 Where where you'd cut .

 Oh no that was because it was actually meant to be one of the shelves for our stereo cabinet but we don't need it so it's now a shelf that's a .

 It's now a silk purse from a sow's ear.

 That's the phrase I was looking for .

 I went to see uh Twenty-One Grams yest last night.

 Oh did you. Naomi Watts.

 Naomi Watts . And y'know uh what do you  w what do you reckon this this is Sean Penn coming home from work.

 Yeah.

 I had this d horrible day today dear.

 Mm.

 I had to fondle Naomi Watts for five hours  horrible job but someone's gotta do it . I only got a million dollars for it .

 You wanna change careers.

 Yes I mean guh thuh th wh what are we doing we're what are we doing here Simon.

 Well you're answering questions  such as this one from Julie in Berkeley Vale how are you Julie.

 Hi good.

 That's good how's your day.

 Ah good so far um yeah nice and sunny.

 Well it'll probably go downhill    from the news let's let's start on that's right you want to paint floor tiles.

 Yeah um uh we've just renovated our house um and we haven't got to the bathroom yet but it's got like Mission Brown floor tiles on it and also the downstairs foyer.

 Can't have too much taupe in your life can you.

 Sorry.

 You can't have too much brown in your life.

 Oh no no not .

 And or beige for that matter.

 Beige is beautiful.

 Beige is a good colour.

 Speaking  it's the colour of your shirt . So what you wanna paint them.

 Yeah yeah and I don't know if there's a product out there that I can actually  paint over the top of the tile.

 Have these got a glaze on them Julie.

 Yeah yeah a slight glaze.

 Uh  um probably not the best surface to paint on I mean if it's a r a rough porous tile  that probably would be fine . Um but I'd I'd uh I yeah I don't think you could guarantee a surface on a on a glazed tile a painted surface on a glazed  tile.

 There certainly is an uh uh an epoxy paint which is d which is ds designed for the purpose. Um and but you may well find that they ask for some sort of a special preparation coat first a coat that would um etch that would etch the glaze otherwise the um.

 You need to get some sort of rough  surface mm.

 A a key a key and.

 Look it th there is a etcher  isn't there.

 I'm I'm almost sure that that the whole answer to the question is yes  that um that the first process will be to apply an etching coat first  and then to apply the two pot um   epoxy uh floor finish.

 Right so you couldn't use that one that they're advertising now um you know to go over the tiles on the wall. As in um I won't say the.

 I I I would suspect that the that the wearing value of that would not be um suitable for floor use.

 Right okay then.

 Mm it's pretty high traffic area isn't it  especially the the the entry.

 A a bathroom a bathroom floor calls for a tremendous amount of work  and and that's why the why it's always glazed  . And um I'd I think though that you'll find that if you go down that same path the the same manufacturer will be able to supply for you a two pot um epoxy paint that would be suitable for the floor.

 And two places to check if you go to a tile supplier and ask if   if they know of such a product  but also  a s they'll probably say no but then  then go to a specialist paint store not  not just the hardware but someone  that specialises in paints where are you Berkeley Vale are you.

 Yeah.

 Where's that.

 On the Central Coast.

 Central Coast.

 On the Central Coast.

 I used I used to have a block of land at  Berkeley Vale  when I was a kid.

 Oh well I just don't know any specialist  paint stores around there.

 .

 I beg your pardon.

 We're central we're the best part of Central Coast.

 Yes  m midway between Wyong and The Entrance.

 No I  let I knew it I was just that's that was my deliberate mistake but it.

 Uh uh it was a test oh I see it was a test.

 Ah that was a test.

 Julie we're being tested.

 There's a specialist paint stores that might have the product you want but you're looking for something to etch the glaze so that you you get a good key I think  that's the trick that's the key to it really.

 Yep  yep.

 Wonderful.

 Alright.

 Okay thank you very much.

 Good luck with it.

 Okay then.

 There we are c  doing the tiles on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney and A B C Radio across New South Wales guess who's coming in after eleven o'clock for Saturday Talk About.

 Dunno.

 We dunno.

 You don't know.

 No he said to  guess.

    Tony Delroy.

 The you're exactly right so isn't that a I love it when Tony .

 But will he turn up.

 Well I dunno.

 I last time he was late.

 Yeah  he's always late isn't  he.

 I listened to Tony's el delway  until two A M this morning.

 And isn't that amazing that he uh uh working till two  and he will be back here at eleven o'clock to do Saturday Talk About.

 That's alright.

 Yeah I think that's okay.

 It's not that good it's just it's what still eight or so hours sleep isn't it.

 Yeah  but we have to pay him penalties because it's working with insufficient break . It's very noble of him and we also have coming along Leon Compton from A B C Goulburn Murray and Jen Fleming producer of A B C Afternoons to look back at the week on the wireless in Saturday Talk About. Let's head off to sunny downtown the town that's got the corner of churches and l on the line we have Janelle how are you Janelle.

 Good thank you.

 Is it uh Hoskins Street four churches on one corner.

 Yes it's uh yes  yes yep that's it.

 But it's no help  to your stained fridge is it.

  No looks like there's some sorta cleanser been used on the front of the fridge and it's got this sorta rusted effect  on the front and I'm just wanting to know whether I could actually use something else to get the rust off or paint over top.

 Ih is the rust actually ih zih biting into the um.

 No.

 Into the steel of of.

 No looks like it's only stained it.

 Oh really  the rust is coming from somewhere it's gotta be coming from the the the metal the .

 Did somebody rest a tin on it or something.

 No no it was just uh there's some wrong sorta cleanser been used on the front of it. And it's just actually stained the front like you can actually see where the wash mark's been done with the  the cleanser on it  on the front.

 How old's the fridge.

 Uh f three or four years  . It's not an old fridge it hasn't been outside or anything like that.

 Yeah.

 I I  I think that that as this damage has occurred to it uh while there there are materials called appliance white and uh and things like that that you can buy from your ha local D I Y shop uh and it does a fair job  I would suggest that because the fridge is still quite young . It may well be worth having it professionally sprayed . Uh where they will bleach the marks out of it first and then  they'll spray it.

 'Cos you want it  the fridge to last for as long   as you can.

 S see that I I would suspect that that that the fridge will will probably last her um seven to fifteen years depending upon make or manufacture and uh it would only cost I would think a hundred-and-fifty dollars for someone to come home and get the fridge and take it away and spray it and bring it back.

 Or take the door it's the door is it.

 Yes it is.

 Yeah just take  the door off.

 Take the door off  yeah that's the idea.

 Um the the the products that that the appliance white products are usually for touching up little  blemishes  rather than a uh than a whole surface .

 Although I have been known to to spray the whole  laundry cupboard . It was totally unsatisfactory  I got into trouble for it.

 Becoh that's quite expensive that stuff you f f you know that would've been quite costly it would've.

 Well I was trying to save having to buy a cupboard.

 Yeah  yeah.

 I didn't get away with it .

 That's all we can think of . So try that.

 At the moment I'm just covering it with children's drawings at the moment so.

 Uh that's a great way to go.

 It's a temporary measure.

 What's ih it's a really obvious brown thing is it.

 Yes it is.

 Mm wonder what you what caused that what sort of cleanser would've caused that.

 Yeah I'm not real sure but yeah just doesn't look very nice at all.

 An and and have you tried various bleaches to remove it.

 Yes.

 Mm I thought they were  gone down that path.

 Sounds like a respray of the door yeah.

 Yes I  it sounds like the like the structure of the of the paint has been affected in  some way.

 Yeah.

 But maybe someone out there's got a bright idea.

 Okay.

 Alright.

 Thanks a lot.

 Thanks Janelle.

 Okay bye.

 There we go quarter past ten seven-oh-two A B C Sydney and A B C Radio across New South Wales y'know Temora's home to the during World War One was the largest R double A F elementary training school.

 Is that so.

 It is.

 Look I tell you Janelle wasn't too impressed with you that you knew the four churches there.  she didn't seem to just wanted to move straight on  to the fridge  yes .

 Still want to know about fridge door.

 That's right.

 N not y not you and your knowledge of the four churches .

 Oh I think it's good to have it's a bit like Adelaide y'know every church every church corner has a  pub opposite.

 It's lovely it's just Janelle wasn't really impressed that uh uh y'know maybe people of Temora are just used to it.

 Bob from Neutral Bay  however has.

 Though what denomination are they I mean it'd be good if they were  Catholic  Proddo a mosque and a synagogue.

 No no no they're all they're all.

 That'd be terrific and and very convenient .

   I reckon . Bob from Neutral Bay said.

 Stop stop now.

 This is remember  we had um uh Julie from Berkeley Vale  . With the uh with the.

 Oh the Central Coast.

 Central Coast.

 Yeah.

 Julie wanted to turn her brown floor tiles a different colour Bob from Neutral Bay said that he once painted his boat a nice blue with epoxy paint he did it   about five years ago and then he accidentally wuh after painting it he  walked on some brown floor tiles with his boots  covered in blue paint  and um uh the paint's been there ever since. So he reckons that   using that boofhead logic  it's hard wearing Julie from Berkeley Vale should use an epoxy paint.

 Tha that's that's why we we said it w we .

 Equals a two pot  a two pot is a  .

 A two pot screamer is epoxy paint.

 Yeah.

 It's a hardener  ih yeah one one part is the .

 A reference hardener.

 Yeah.

 An and apply it with the boot of a shoe  boot sole of a boot.

 Well I think yes that's .

 There you go Julie give it do a practice bit somewhere.

 Yeah paint a boat and then do it that way.

 Yeah.

 Geoff

 Yes.

 How are you.

 Not too bad here Simon.

 You've got squeaky chipboard floors.

 Yes over the years you've answered quite a few questions on uh s squeaky uh timber floors but  not so much on squeaky uh wood panel floors or chipboard floors. I've got an upstairs area with carpet uh over chipboard  and just wondered what to do either now or even potentially in the future if I wanna take the carpet up and uh replace it with either more carpet or uh with timber floors.

 Just renail it. It's uh y'know um use the spiral nails uh normally chipboard floors are glued to the uh  structure and some  people don't. And sometimes they're squeaking at the joins and sometimes uh in fact almost all the time where the board where the the board often uh a join is not straddling a piece of structure and it's not even required to because they're set up so that they can they can cope with that  that little span so so um that causes the squeak but the best thing is to um go over it and renail it quite cluh I mean you'd put a nail every three-hundred mil . Uh use a spiral fifty mil nail or even a sixty-five mil  spiral. And uh.

  screws if I screwed it.

 Oh fantastic.

 Oh yeah by all means yeah yeah.

 Yeah it's just a lot it's y'know  it'd be a lot a more time consuming but that would be better. Um uh but and then you can I suppose dump some talc along the joins y'know the actual where the boards wih the joints of the of the actual sheets. But um it's more likely to be with that sort of product squeaking because it's pulled itself off the joists   a little bit loose.

 I always glue glue that stuff down.

 Mm.

 Okay then thanks very much.

 It's too late now you can't glue it is it a first floor.

 It's  the first floor.

 It's at the top so you can't get underneath it.

 No.

 No um no I think it y it's all you can do is renail it.

 Just renail it yep.

 But or either sc or screw that's even better but if you nail it use a spiral use something with a helix on it so it really pulls the board  down.

 And and ih if that squeak happens to be um in an u in a piece of unsustent uh uh unsupported floor. Well then you might uh when the floor's up uh c c can you at at the underside of the floor.

 Not at all.

 No.

 It's got a f ceiling in the way.

 Yeah  lool look with with particle board it's usually that it's pulled up and it's sliding up and down on the on the fasteners yeah. Alright so that's all you all really all you can do and all you need to do.

 Uh 'cos quite often they're nailed with a with a gun.

 And if I replaced the upstairs carpet with timber I'd just go over the top of the uh the particle board with that.

 With timber how do you mean timber floorboards.

 Yeah yeah possibly timber floorboards.

 Yeah well you'd  uh few little little issues there one's ceiling height and the obvious the cutting the doors up and all that but you're nailing gotta find the joist to nail the boards to and you've gotta somehow cramp the boards and you can't grab the joist with a floor cramp because there's  particle board underneath . If you you use a kiln dried product that then w then will expand a little bit you'd probably get the boards tight enough but don't be surprised if once you've done it you you get little  cracks opening up.

 Yeah mooh  moving gap.

 Yeah you'll get little gaps between the floorboards. That's not an un  that's not  uh unattractive thing yeah. But use kiln dried material uh and leave 'n' 'n' s put it down when it's quite dry.

 All floorboards expand and contract.

 Thank you very much.

 Thanks Geoff.

  at least it won't squeak.

 That's right. 

 Thanks for that Geoff.

 Famous last words.

 But it won't but it won't.

 No no no.



 It is twenty past ten seven-oh-two A B C Sydney and A B C Radio across New South Wales the Weekend Woodies you've got your tool.

 I have.

 It's a not it's a very nice one  it yeah yep oh okay you wanna do it now.

 No no any time.

 Well give us a teaser luh gih ih dih ih . Oh it's for tuning in the orchestra isn't it  . It's a triangle you've just joined the percussion group.

 Bong bong.

 It's medication  time.

 Medication time .

 Let's head off to uh ah uh  Terry in Harboard who wants to know whether he should wax. Terry are you there. Hello Terry.

  Simon.

 You wanna you wanna get a wax.

 Just the back or the .

  Yeah.

 Or the whole thing .

 The whole thing the whole goal.

 Now it depends how hairy you are Terry.

  Not very so won't be a big job.

 Alright now this is the old timber deck question.

 No not not an old one I've just built a timber deck.

 Oh no the old question but the new timber deck.

 New timber deck yeah . And it's uh it's all external and uh I'm not really  all that uh keen on putting on a um um a varnish or something because of the  the work that is involved with keeping it up there um with brushing it all the time.

 Mm.

 Mm.

 But possibly uh an oil finish or maybe a wax finish or something on the on the timber it's um it's iron bark on all the handrails and I've used white mahogany on the posts.

 That's lovely.

 So uh and.

 Sounds  like a beautiful deck.

 See that that this you've you've done something very wise you've chosen materials that are durability one  for a start   and so the the the material is going to last. But uh and and you've also selected an oil finish to go over it and the oil finish will um  will will help to prevent the sun from drying out the surface fibres of the wood which is also a plus um and by putting an oil over it  you do you do need to come back to it every two or three years and hit it again . But um but the oil is certainly the most refurbishable.

 And when you're doing it every two or three years do you have to l sand and then oil or is it just a matter of slapping it on and walking away.

 Depends on how  clean it up> on on on how early you get it. You you just keep your eyes on it and the moment it starts to show any  d deterioration  .

 Gee what are you doing Terry  minding the deck  yeah> ah still watching that deck .

 I'm watching the deck.

 Don't you think  you should go out or go the toilet.

 No I'm watching the deck.

 Look ih uh if if you do know what I mean  uh just keep your eyes on it and if it starts to look a bit sad whip another coat into it straight away now you'll find that in so doing you'll be able to simply uh recoat or overcoat it every couple of years. Uh from time to time it will start to fade a bit and uh and if it does just give it a a paint over with a with a wood cleaning product. And that's a that's a paint on hose off operation and then come back 'n' give it another another coat of oil.

 Okay.

 What are the floorboards.

 They're no uh actually terracotta tiles. The whole the the the deck.

 Oh I see so it's uh like like a fibre cement.

  balustrading and the posts and of course all the fob subdeck frame is all timber.

 Yep and you've got fibre cement and you've sealed that  so that you don't get water getting under the structure underneath.

  polyurethane uh membrane and then come up from there. But what I was wondering about is the in the linseed oil or maybe m some more like.

 No linseed.

 No no linseed oil it go goes sticky. It's a pain the neck.

 Also.

 It won't dry.

 Yeah helps mould to grow all sorts of things like that.

 So you're better off buh getting something like a.

 Proprietary line and you go for the highest U V rating you can. The higher the U V rating  the less often you have to paint it.

 Okay then.

 Yeah and there are proh there are products especially for there are d things  there's a product called decking oil and a couple of. No no but it's the company call it. A lotta the companies  have it they call it decking oil.

 Right it's a line.

 It's a that's a  .

 Oil for decking oil  oil for painting decks  or.

 Okay .

 Okay then uh you've answered the question thanks very much Woodies.

 Thanks  Terry.

 Okay bye.

 There we are Terry's going to uh oil the deck as they say in the trade.

 He's not he's go he's unda  oil the handrails and posts and things  because the deck's got terracotta tiles on it.



 Ah look tool of the week. Can I just uh we have uh my email has been down all week and I finally worked out how to change the uh the pop account which is a technical term   young people use to  make people like me feel old  and uh I've changed.

 Imagine how we feel Simon.

 .

 Well no you're .

 What's email .

 I'm o well I I'm only thirty-nine I don't know about you.

 Yeah I had to explain to Peter no that's a she male when he first told me about these  things  yes y'know. Um no no no and and so but I did finally get them through at about uh nine o'clock this morning and one of  them says  I would like to nominate the uh is it okay just to ignore him .

 Just ignore him .

 Yes just ignore him. Um give him it ritalin and he'll be fine  . Um  . What was I saying. Yes that he would like to nominate the person that uh uploads the tool of the week onto the internet the world wide web as boofhead  because they haven't been uploaded for uh six weeks now. And um I'm I'm it's not we've got the photos haven't we.

 Yes we've got the photos  and and we've got the text.

 Have we got the text.

 The the text but but it keeps on keeps on getting thrown back so I therefore  I sent it direct to you.

 Oh I haven't got it yet.

 Oh hasn't arrived.

 No .

 Did you send it by email though .

 I sent it by email.

 Oh so we just say the boofhead's in the mail . That's the new cho it's the new phrase  the boofhead and the cheque is in the mail . Let's do the vuh tool of the week now  and we get this one online .

  Alright huh the .

 Don't you meh dare mention that family .

 Oke . Alright now the  the tool I have is is is a very very useful  D I Y tool.

 It looks nice .

 It it it's used for  for detail plastering 'n' plaster repair  uh and the tool's quite small and it's called a plasterer's small tool. And it has a  a small  trowel shaped end on  one end.

 Yes.

 And a rectangular face on the other.

 Yeah.

 Uh so that it's the same configuration.

 But it looks like a really mini trowel y'know how a trowel.

 But yeah like like like a little   like a little little mini trowel  .

 It's for tooling plaster into all sorts of little corners.

 Into into corners and crevices.

 While I say that there's no such thing as a carpenter's small tool is there Les.

 No they're built like.

 No  no   there isn't.

 So this is it's fine metal it's very beautifully made  is this a very expensive tool.

 No no no no no no no no that that um sort of under twenty dollars.

 You're kidding.

 It's like a mini trowel isn't it.

 Mini trowel so I can shape with with precision  and then scrape the cah.

 And there's the fact thuh fact th the that the trowel shaped face is only about fifty millimetres long means that you can get into fine detail places and then on the other end  the the um the plasterer's trowel face where it's rectangular um it when it once again it's quite small so therefore you can get into small detailed areas.

 And and.

 It's a very very useful tool.

 As Diana Fisher on The Inventors used to say Alicia has now come up with another thing she says that it looks like a perfect baby cheesecake server.

 Mm well it is.

 Yeah.

 Al y alt alternatively.

 So it's got many uses around  the home.

 Al alternatively it's a baby cheesecake server.

 That's right.

 But it's a pretty it is a pretty thing isn't it funny how.

 So it's a tool for y'know evny  use any room in the house.

 When things when something uh does the job really well it usually looks good it's that  form and function thing and it's   that's one of those it's very pretty.

 Marvellous.

 And we'll take a photo of that and get it on the net for tool of the week.



 Very shortly John Hall along to uh do news headlines at twenty-eight minutes past ten. Couple of fridge suggestions Brian from beautiful Blacktown said he had a rust problem with his fridge he fixed it by cleaning it with a scourer. Then he got a pack of pressure pack paint from the hardware I'm sure he just said that so that  he could see whether   I could say it  Peter Pider  picked a pecker . He got a pack of pressure pack paint from the hardware that was four years ago and it's still all good.

 Yes.

 Oh good.

 There we go Greg from Sefton says try some heavy cutting floor polish or car polish on the fridge and then use a finishing polish  y'know the  cutting polish  for a car.

 Yeah absolutely  she should try that first actually 'cos it might ih.

 A little abrasive sort of is very soh not is  yep. And then Robin from Illawong says cut out a piece of laminex  glue it on put plastic mouldings around the edges and hey hey no more rust. But you'd have to remove the rust first 'cos you don't want it to corrode underneath that do you.

 That'd look bloody awful.

 Would it.

 Uh that's a horrible idea  .

 Something to see Monday morning  um station manager Simon can you just explain why we lost Robin from Illawong as a listener  .

 Nothing personal Robin . No no don't give up your day job Robin .

  So there we are a couple of suggestions for the uh the rusty fridge and they'll be coming through as well. We'll find out about headlines next .



 .

 And this is seven-oh-two A B C Sydney and A B C Radio across New South Wales.

 What colour is the laminex.

 That Robin wants to put on the uh. 

 Yes fridge  door.

 I reckon taupe would be nice . Brown.

 Or   gold gold with brown trim would be nice.

 Gold and then you could put little green around it  and old photos from the two-thousand olympics and calls it call it your Aussie Aussie Aussie oi oi oi fridge . I think that'd be beautiful . Let's find out what's happening in the news headlines and a very good morning to John Hall.



 More news at eleven.

 We look forward to it . And John.

 Standing by.

 Uh you I know that patiently throughout the whole morning you've had your all that zinc cream on your nose ready to go out and enjoy the daylight you can finally do it and just after the news at twelve.

 He's he's wearing his flippers already isn't he 'n' his   swimming goggles he just flaps out of the  .

 Don't let them stir you just   nice shirt John  I   I I like the shirt . Very good.

 His Hawaiian shirt his snorkel his goggles his flippers and he just fl flaps   out up out .

 Hey John   Trisha McDonald said to say hello.

 Oh there's a blast from the past.

 Isn't it  I think we'd be talking Forbes Street days there.

 I think we might be.

 There we are sh.

 A long time ago.

 Emailed me this week and said that  you were the best weekend announcer ever.

 Well second best eh .

  Quick as a flash.

 John Hall back at the news at eleven o'clock on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney and A B C Radio across New South Wales June from Glebe has called in to say she's trying to buy  a triangular square which was the tool of the week from a while back and nobody knows what it is. You imagine 'scuse me I'd like to buy  a triangular square well it's square madam no this one's triangular .

 Ih ih .

 How many corners does it have  ma'am it three well that's a triangle no I want a triangular square  what is the other name.

 It's bright yellow plastic.

 Yes.

 To identify it for you and uh.

 But what does she walk into the hardware store 'cos they are intimidating places  and they'll have a lend of you at any opportunity so she wants to walk in there and use the proper builder's term what is it.

 It's a s.

 It's actually a square but  it's ih this particular one is in a triangular shape  . But the  but it has a the operative it has a ninety degree angle  one it's an isosceles triangle  .

 Isn't it. Isn't it yes it is you're right y.

 Yeah go  she should go in and say I want an isosceles triangle  right where the square on  the hypotenuse  equals the sum of the square on the other two sides .

 And this guy just draws on a piece of paper a triangle and says that'll be nine bucks thanks.

 Y yeah .

  That's right.

 Yeah just it it's bright yellow plastic. So y you ask for a bright yellow plastic square.

 A bright yellow  plastic square. Which you use to measure

 In the shape of an isosceles triangle yeah. 

 Alright.

 Uh and it's all she can do.

 They just get a laugh .

 Uh look well she's getting a photo off the internet isn't she of the thing she could take she could t download  the photo and take it all . Yeah if and  when that gets done because we always get around to doing the stuff we promise . Yes .

 Yes Deirdre. Are you there Deirdre. In Coonabarabran. Deirdre.

 No it's Judy in Coonabarabran.

 Oh is it.

 Yes.

 How are you.

 Oh well I'm well thank you.

 That's  good. Sorry I got your name wrong.

 Oh that's alright Deirdre's a nice name.

 It is.

 Um I'm hoping you can help me I've I don't quite know how to describe this but I've inherited a a bentwood rocking chair big big one  large one uh grandfather size.

 Oh good.

 Uh yes well it would be except the last owner the carers cared for the owner but not the chair.

 Ah so it needs some work.

 It needs some work it I didn't know whether to oil it because if I can describe you know the circles that they bend  to infill the out outer rocker frame . There are two circles and where they I don't know to call it a mitre it's not exactly a mitre but where this joins to make the circle  has come apart.

 Right yes yes.

 So there's a gap.

 Yep.

 And I don't know how to get it back also uh on the top it must've been rickety because they put two screws into the top through the bentwood wood which breaks my heart  but I don't know how to go about  repairing.

 The two screws through the bentwood may well be standard that they they quite often um put a screw through the the bentwood frame to hold the two pieces together  . But uh I I I I wouldn't worry about that but but where the where the joint's come apart is the chair still sufficiently flexible that you can actually close it up again.

 No no it's not flexible.

 Alright okay well and and how wide's the gap.

 Oh about .

 A quarter of an inch.

 No it wouldn't be quarter oh yes about a quarter down to about an eighth.

 Okay um I I'd I'd be. I'd I think what I'd do is I'd just clean out any loose material in the gap . And uh I'd very carefully mix up some uh some of that uh two pot glue some  Araldite alright . Uh the the twenty-four hour one not the long term sorry about that but everybody makes  them the the two pot epoxy it might be a Bostik it might be a a Selleys suh w who h but they all they all make them.

 But won't that show uh as an in im in.

 Ih in yeah it it it will it'll be a a a dark grey colour when it dries.

 N no it's not the colour it's the s shape. Wouldn't it alter the curve of the the the circle.

 No what wuh  yuh 'n' 'n' ih thih this does not flex at all it it's it's still still lying quite normal.

 Mm except where it's making the gap is spoiling the circle.

 Oh I see  it it  sounds like you need a n need somebody with cramp to actually  cramp the thing closed.

 Yes as long  as it wouldn't break the wood then you know .

 No but just just I I'd it it won't c it won't be very expensive to have done.

 Ah.

 Juh juh juh just have a talk to um  to to a a local cabinet maker  uh theh there's bound to be one in town or a carpenter in town  it's a very easy job. And uh and all they'll do is that they'll put the the epoxy glue into the gap and then they'll close it up with a cramp and then it'll be back to normal shape.

 Yes well uh uh puh sort of do it gently uh  a little bit at a time you mean.

 But but but a cramp will give them the control that they need to slowly close it up  back into its place.

 I see yes I get it.

 Yep.

 Well thank you very much.

 There's uh gotta be a good old woodworker somewhere around there.

 Ih ih it will  be worth having it done properly  because sounds like a lovely chair . It may well be quite valuable.

 Yes I think perhaps it is.

 And and therefore if you.

 Anyway it's very comfortable.

 Ih if you do  something slipshod it  it devalues it.

 Exactly exactly.

 There's gotta be somebody up at the Pilliga state forest round there that works in wood that would be able to help you out.

 Well I'll try.

 Alright good look with  it.

 Thank you very much.

 Thank you.

  pull it together with just  rope it up and then and tighten and  pull it together with the rope.

 The thing is that you see that that that while the rope would do that it doesn't give you the control . And and we what we need to close up in in this funny configuration is to control of a couple of cramps.

 Ian from Lismore wants to know where you get the appliance white paint that the Woodies mentioned earlier is that just a generic line name.

 Yeah ih it's.

 Yeah it's  not a tr it's not a trade name.

 It's a it's a pressure pack and once again every   it's actually called  it it's called  appliance white.

 Appliance white . And also as far as w what the triangular square is  from the tool of the week  earlier  we've had a couple of suggestions Sandy who um  says that she knows one of the Woodies uh very well.

  Yeah go on.

  Is Les gunna  have a good time when he gets home. He's gunna be teased about this all weekend Sandy rang to say d'oh it's called a quick square.

 Go on.

 .

 I I  I I'm not going down this path .

 You're not going down this one. And Rod from Homebush r called in to say if you walk in and ask for a  sixty-thirty set square  uh you'll be right  and Rob also pointed out that that shape is a scalene triangle Woodies.

 Scalene eh.

 Yeah.

 But but I think that the quick square is isosceles anyway .



 Ah yes and we have a boofhead of the week coming up uh Dawn's on the line in h Illihong  Dawn.

 Scalene I thought that was that that dry skin you get on on the elbow y'know.

 No.

 No it's a  set square.

 Scalene was the she male you were talking  to in the  pub last night .

 Scalene the she male yes .

 Dawn's on the line in Illawong how are you Dawn.

 I'm fine thank you.

 I love this the way it's been put up on the screen can her ol can your old deck be put in the log fire.

 Well that's right yes it's one of those combustion fires.

 Right.

 But it has been painted with that um uh uh y'know paint that they use for outdoors on decking.

 Yeah.

 And I'm just wondering would there be any fumes or anything .

 Fumes is it safe.

 Mm.

 Mm.

 Mm.

 Painted with when you say paint is it an oil that it's been painted with.

 Um oh what's that  coverall that uh.

 Just a deck paint or something.

 Yeah.

 Mm.

 I I wouldn't not for sake of anything except for the pitch that it may well form on the inside of the chimney . And it may well um  cause a fire on the inside of the chimney flue.

 Oh I see.

 I I'm I w I don't think I'd be worried about it being inside the fire because  the door's shut 'n'  uh et cetera cetera cetera but I think that I would avoid using it in the fire because I'd be concerned that the oily nature of the material that's been used to paint it might cause some some ex.

 Ah it'll build up.

 E excessive build-up within the chimney flue.

 Good call.

 Do you think if I um if I just used it sparingly along with other wood not sort of just burn that alone do you think that might be .

 Uh I I I would still recommend against it  because over the period of time  the same amount of  material will be burned and the same amount of of uh material will go up the flue.

 Oh right  actually  I'm I'm planning on getting rid of the fire after this winter so  I wouldn't be worrying after that but.

 Well burn it then.

 So it would be alright just for one season.

 Uh.

 I I'm I I'm just concerned about about the  inside of the flue becoming um a fire hazard.

 Right.

 That's all.

 Okay.

 Is it a is it a metal flue is a brick f.

 Yes a metal flue.

 Uh just I'm a nervuh  I I'm a nervous old coot that's all.

 Yes  so am I.

 'Cos if it's just a thin coating uh was it oh by the way is a was it a a treated pine deck to start with or a hardwood.

 Uh hardwood.

 Oh right if it's treated pine  then absolutely don't burn it.

 No no  it's hardwood.

 'Cos that  treatment then it's fine .

 Mm mm. Um yeah yeah  so if well I wouldn't be as nervous as Les about it but it's still with some reservations I'd  uh uh but if you've gettih getting rid of the fire next year anyway.

 Uh I'm a just going to keep it this winter and then I'm used to l uh rid of it.

 Yeah and uh y y c  yeah it's such a good s it's there it is it's firewood and  it's oh it's a teaser isn't it.

  and there's just so much of it that um it'd be great if I could burn it you know and not just um  .

 Why don't you just have a little fire just in a little drum or something in the backyard and have a look burn it and see if any black s smoh any if it burns nice and and cleanly . Uh and you'd see no pr n uh doesn't produce any kind of s serious smoke or black smoke  or white smoke then it's probably okay.

 Dawn what we're a what  this is the radio equivalent of what you used to see in cartoons where the person'd be wondering  whether to do it and you get the little angel on one shoulder  and you've got the little devil  at the other. And  essentially what it comes down to is you've gotta see who you trust most.

 Yes.

 Okay then.

 But have  a practise burn in a drum and see if it burns nice  and cleanly why not.

 Well that sounds a good idea I'll start with that anyway.

 Yeah  see she's an adventurer she wants to  she wants to  live on edge  right she wants to walk the tightrope .

 Fire's burning.

 Sixteen away from eleven on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney uh Paul from Tullaburgill Tullibigeal sorry  is on the line is that right Paul.

 I am here.

 And y apparently you're an expert on all sorts of squares and set squares.

 Well it sorta comes through because I remember seeing a parallel when I went to school I did tech drawing and I did woodwork and in both classes  the piece of plastic or wood that had a ninety degree angle on one corner  was referred to as a set square . You used it to set the square angle in a drawing or whatever.

 Uh yep.

 And the other square that is commonly used which is basically shaped like two bits of material wood or steel  uh and you use it to try the edge of a piece of material.

 Is a try square.

 That's called a try square.

 Is a try square you got it.

 Yeah. He's absolutely c he's absolutely right.

 Yeah but  but but  but.

 And when somebody wants to repaint their fridge  all they've gotta do is stand back and bomb the thing with some white automotive paint.

 Bomb it  that's a nice technique so ih spray it with the white automotive paint.

 Yeah yeah that you don't need special fridge paint y'know just ordinary white automotive paint'll do the job nicely.

 Uh it it would it will tend to be a bit stark and white and may therefore stand out like a neon light against the remainder of the fridge body.

 Perhaps so but you could also repaint the fridge with any one of a plethora of colours available in the automotive paint catalogue.

 Yeah.

 Or probably  have a  mustang orange   with a G T stripe.

 Put a V eight sign on it and.

 Put a little sticker  this fridge is rocking  don't bother knocking.

 Yeah.

 Or y'know don't laugh it might be your daughter in here.

  yes for your cool daughter.



 It is fifteen minutes away from eleven on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney after eleven Tony Delroy Leo k Leon Compton and Jen Fleming look back at the week on the wireless got a few calls to get through and we'll see how quickly we can do it 'cos Linda's been waiting very patiently in Wahroonga well Linda how are you.

 Good thank you.

 Your parquetry floor is cupping.

 Yes it is.

 Ah what can we do  with a cupping floor  Woodies.

 Are the are the each little bits of parquetry cupping individually or or there are larger sections of  uh y'know uh a whole bunch of boards cupping.

 The whole floor. They're slightly cupping it's newly laid . What I'm wondering if we get the installer back  and he sands it all and does it again will that solve it.

 No.

 Ih it it may provided all other things are equal Les is shaking his head but um is ih was it laid onto a concrete slab.

 Yes. 

 Um and were any tests done on the slab to see whether it was uh dry enough to  to to be ready to lay the parquetry.

 Well what they did firstly  was they had a sort of a rubber membrane that they  put all over the floor to stop any moisture coming up through the slab . That was meant to dry overnight virtually . It took two weeks to dry . And then they came out again and put another rubber membrane over it . It dried quicker and then they laid the parquetry on top.

 Is it a large area.

 Yes.

 Mm y yeah this one it should be looked at by a building consultant I think just  because there are a couple of possibilities the the whatever product was used on the floor may have re-emulsified and and not actually ever dried um uh there are some issues that should be that should be looked at on a hands on situation by a building consultant I think.

 I'll bet any money th the house is air conditioned .

 Uh yes it is.

 Mm mm.

 But this this started before the ih with before  we started using the air conditioning.

 See what's happening what's happening is this . That there's a moisture content in the parquetry material and that moisture content or the humidity of the of the interior of the wood m m declares that that that the wood is of a certain shape and size and the air conditioning is almost certainly upsetting the uh the humidity in that area um is the is the part that's affected in the room that's air conditioned.

 Well with the air conditioning this was installed last July we've neh  ih this cupping started before we s even turned  on the air conditioning  it's in the house.

 Uh well then it but it's nonetheless being caused by  variations to the humidity in the room and hyuh and variations therefore to the size of the pieces of parquetry. They're expanding and contracting  because they're real wood  um.

 But if it's cupping and peaking Les it's mainly suh uh absorbing moisture rather than  losing it and  and it's absorbing it from somewhere and it's just difficult for us to say for certain that that isn't from the slab underneath for some reason.

 I think that  a building consultant would be money well spent.

 Mm.

 Uh who should I contact then.

 Well there is  there.

 Should have ringed that favour  in.

 You can contact the Institute of Building Consultants.

 Mhm.

 So  they're the umbrella body.

 Uh that's one of them and the Master Builder's Association also have accredited consultants and they can recommend someone in your area.

 Mhm.

 The Institute of Building Consultants' number is have you got a pen.

 Uh y yes.

 It's a Sydney number  n.

 Okay.

 Nine-six-five-one.

 Uhuh.

 Two-nine-seven-five.

 Uhuh.

 Nine-six-five-one-two-nine-seven-five they'll recommend a building consultant and it is good so that when you do have the person that laid the parquetry floor come back in you've got a s independent uh  finding on it and you both of you can work together to  fix the problem  in your best interest.

 Yeah there's a lot better.

  that he mucked up the job I wouldn't like say for certain without you can't say  without seeing it.

 The expertise  uh that the building consultant brings to the argument is worth the money.

 Uhuh.

 Alright.

 Uh what another quick question uh this um installer had insurance  and I I thought well we're gunna be fine if there's a problem   but hih psh insurance with H I A and they said it doesn't cover faulty workmanship.

 Again this  is a matter for the building consultant to work out can he advise on that.

 They'll advise on uh they'll look at that whatever inshu uh insurance uh is available to you um yeah absolutely to some extent but really wuh it gets there's a fine line sometimes if it comes at becomes a legal problem and then you need to get legal advice from  a solicitor.

 Yeah.

 Uhuh.

 Building consultant usually tells you what the problem is with the uh with the job and if that pr a and if it's a mistake or an error by the installers . They'll tell you that much 'n' they'll give you some hints on uh where you can go with the Department of Fair Trading 'n' what have you but then you uh if it if it gets to that you see your solicitor hopefully.

 Alright then.

 Mm.

 Alright.

 Okay.

 Thanks Linda.

 Thank you.

 Good luck with it.

 Thank you.

 Ten away from eleven.



 Terry from Bathurst has rung in to say that he had a rusty fridge problem and I like this one. So what he did he painted the rusty fridge with blackboard paint and now he can write his s shopping on the fridge . It's really hard to fit the fridge in his pocket when he goes  out.

 I like a man with a solution for everything weh well done mate well done.

 That is good uh Bob's on the line in Croydon how are you Bob.

 I'm well thanks how are you.

 Very well you wanna get French polish off the table.

 Yes yes I um my sister bought a table and I acted the expert and thought I knew how to do it.

 Uh oh.

 And uh just want a bit of advice .

 What have you done so far.

 Haven't touched it yet but I thought I'd uh take to it with some steel wool and metho.

 Do you intend to refurbish it or strip it off completely.

 Strip it off completely.

 First hire a stripper oops  buh duh duh.

 Duh duh duh .

  We won't go there.

 No.

 Uh uh the the it's why not.

 I love talking about strippers .

 Not that sort of stripper Peter  just just down boy down down down. Gee .

 What's wrong with nude women Les what have you got against .

 Hope you like the tablets.

 There we go  another   ritalin.

 I I  another ritalin yeah I I I'd be inclined to uh ih  if the if the French polish that's on it now uh is the kind of finish that you intend to replace it with um and it's not badly perished well then what you're gunna do with the with the the steel wool and the  and the methylated spirits will work as long as you work along the grain . Be very easy with the steel wool to to make circular scratches that are s that are there forever . Um uh I I I think that I'd probably be more inclined to use an ordinary commercial stripper.

 Oh okay.

 That because it's designed for the purpose and all the metho'll do is soften the French polish  where um the strip the stripper will be will completely destroy it and will come away without any trouble um th there there are  th there's a um a stripper that that you can what's that that one you paint on and peel off Pete.

 Oh um the strip uh wuh peel away system.

 Now the peel away system  uh the that that that might do you do you very well on on a piece like this because you maintain such good controls of it.

 Okay and.

 You're you're only only gunna do this to the top aren't you.

 Uh no the whole thing.

 Oh no well ih well ih well then just use any old stripper 'n' and strip the whole lot whole lot and hose it off .

 Okay and in terms of finishing it it's a t I think it's Tasmanian blackbutt .

 Go on.

 . 

 .

 Looks like we. You you've lost these other pair go on  I yeah I'm with you.

 Completely haven't I.

 Yeah they're gone.

 What would I finish it with she wants something fairly durable and hard.

 .

 Uh uh m make sure that  you get.

 Got his mind  on stripper hasn't he .

 Theh theh theh they've gone down a very bad path here the pair of them.

 Yeah .

 Let's recap  we want any old stripper with a black butt.

 No we don't we want  t any old stripper with a black butt. Now now look .

 Guys keep it clean come  on please.

 Now now  it's very incuh important that you that you get the basis of the material clean you get all of the  the stripped material off first. Um y wuh when you were talking about using fine steel wool before if you do go down that path with the st fine steel wool you want the oh-oh-oh-oh steel wool.

 Right.

 Um don't don't use the stuff that you use for your kitchen kitchen pots and pans  because that will scratch it.

 Proper really fine oh-oh-oh-oh-oh.

 And  and having removed all of the  all the old material um you could use a just a a uh a satin polyurethane if you wanted to.

 Okay.

 It buh it'd be hard wearing  um. Oh  I I I wouldn't go back to French polish again  what what sort of table is it.

 Uh ih dining room table.

 Is it expensive is it  valuable.

 I think it's uh a family type table.

 Oh yes.

 Ih ih w well t just just before you attack it too severely make sure that you're not devaluing a valuable piece of furniture because the the moment that you take the French polish off and put polyurethane on um there are those who would certainly say that you'd devalued the  the quality the of the furniture.

 You get your sister to sign a a deed of release saying that that that you've rel released from any responsibility at all  before starting the job .

 Oh dear me.

 No he could.

 But I I'd  I'd I would strip it with a stripper.

 Thank you.

 Alright.

 Anh anh and then I'd remove any of the old material with a  with a um uh  piece of steel wool and methylated spirits. And the steel wool and metho will of course will remove the last uh residual of polish and then a light sanding with s say about two-hundred-and-forty or three-hundred-and-forty grade aluminium oxide paper. That's that white abrasive paper  and and then uh some satin polyurethane.

 That sounds great thank you very much.

 And will you let us know how it goes.

 Will.

 There we go and also waiting very patiently on the line in Nowra Joan good morning.

 Oh good morning. I feel as though somebody's been having a lend of me and sent me to the hardware store for a long wait.

 Oh yes .

 .

 Oh as consolation for being for doing for waiting so long we'll send you down a left handed hammer okay.

 Thank you very much .

 And a sky hook.

 Oh thank you.

  Are you.

 Look um we're looking at buying um a fairly old house about thirty years old and it's fibro lined. Um  uh I'm not too sure of the distan the difference between asbestos and fibro I want to know are there any uh concerns for health reasons or.

 It's a good question.

 Look it's safe  in that form it does if it's that old and it's ih ih fibro simply a fibre cement sheet where the the strengthening fibres within the cement encased within the cement are asbestos fibres. Now if you it's dangerous if you drill it um y'know mm mm huh tamper with it such that you produce um dust and and all that sort of stuff but if it's just sitting there and painted it's fine every f.

 If it's unbroken  and in a whole piece.

 Every fibro house in Sydney's got asbestos in it  every old fibro house has.

 If you're gunna paint  theh use you y use a plastic spatula ra rather than a s a steel spatula. Don't sand it um you w you want to avoid disturbing the surface of the asbestos.

 Mm.

 It looks fine as a matter of fact I wouldn't have picked it up to be fibro y'know until it was  pointed out to me it's a really good job  but if we decided to plaster it wuh could you plaster over the top.

 Over the top yep.

 Straight  over the top.

 Yep yep.

 As long as you bear in mind you're not gunna do anything that disturbs the surface.

 No she doesn't mean plastering I think she's talking about putting plasterboard  you would put a plasterboard over the top nailing through to the studs and that would be fine.

 Okay now wuh there is one little wall small wall we want to take down would you take the sheets out as whole.

 Yep.

 Well then when you start working with fibro there are guidelines aren't there Peter.

 There are WorkCover um provides the uh the guidelines for how to dispose of it 'n' 'n' how to deal with it but the best thing to do is to take it off in the largest possible size sheets so that you'd punch you'd find the fixing nails   punch them through and then lift the sheet away use y'know wear a mask and just vacuum up everything and maybe even just slightly dampen the  the the proh take it out and then you get a licensed rubbish removalist to remove it and that's no.

 'Cos you c definitely can't just throw it in the bin either.

 No.

 And is that expensive to get .

 Uh it's not that much more expensive I mean if you were if it say that normally the rubbish removal's gunna be two-hundred it might be two-hundred-and-fifty.

 Right.

 It's that sort of thing all they do is wrap it in plastic and take it to um where are you.

 Oh Nowra.

 Nowra.

 Oh right well they take it to a a a tip that um bury it basically.

 Yeah I I pictured them turning up in those big plastic suits and.

 No.

 Oh in the white suits  and they put a whole plastic sheet over the house and wear  breathing equipment no .

 And take out your two sheets of fibro no.

 Yeah not E T .

 Play spooky music.

 Yeah no it's not as bad as that but it ih it l y'know you need to be.

 It's good to be very aware of it.

 And prudent when you're dea when you're dealing  with it.

 You don't need to be f frightened of it and there is a lot of information on that WorkCover site.

 Does it devalue a property ih like if ih ih um when you resell or.

 Look it may a little bit I guess but only because ih ih it was  it was probably an inexpensive way of getting of of of lining an interior of the house really it's more to do with that n rather than the fact that it's fibro it's just not as good an insulator 'n'  um mm would be  better if if down the track you you put plasterboard over the top of it.

 It'll be fine.

 Is it ceilings and walls.

 As far uh we're not we haven't really checked the ceilings  but you can see um a crack right along not a crack you know .

 Are the ceilings  battened or.

  right along one sheet which maybe it is maybe  that's plaster not sure.

 No but it's pretty safe if you don't tamper with it and um.

 Yeah  it's certainly not something you'd say oh I'm not gunna buy that house 'cos of fibro if if  you like the house  you like where it is it's what you can afford    go ahead.

 Thank you very much.

 Alright.

 That was worth waiting for.

 And make sure you find out about WorkCover 'cos that's they've got a lot of information there.

 Alright then thank you.

 Thanks Joan.

 Thank you bye.

 Enjoy the long wait.

 Thank you 

 There you go   down in Nowra.

 We'll send you some multicoloured paint some rainbow.

 Rainbow paint'd be  beautiful on the fibro wouldn't it.

 Bit of black and white maybe.

 Yeah some black and white paint that sounds really good Tony Delroy Leon Compton and Jen Fleming up after the news apologies to Paula and Jacintha uh w I might even ask the guys if they'll answer the phone during the noise but right now it is eleven o'clock  news time.
"
" Thanks for that John Hall now John Hall will be listening for the next hour 'cos Angus Stewart is here to take your calls eight-triple-three-one-thousand one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two something in the garden that's causing you problems give us a call right now and Angus can I mean y'know he is known in the trade as Mr popergation  Mr propagation. He's also known for his passion for natives and his love of o orchids am I right so far.

 I guess yeah yeah .

 He's also known  for his ability to open cosposting  toilets so he can tell you anything worm farm problems certainly helped us and although I'm still confused about dry ingredients we might talk about that as well but eight-triple-three-one-thousand one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two fine sunny day today top temperatures on the coast of twenty-seven inland thirty degrees Bowral enjoying twenty-seven and Katoomba twenty-five degrees currently around town on the coast it's seventeen that's four below  r Richmond and Bankstown are fifteen degrees Penrith sixteen Katoomba thirteen and Gosford twelve. One of the jewels in the open garden scheme crown is opening today and this is just a garden to envy how would you like  to have  a beautiful sandstone cottage nestled underneath a waterfall with a little pond and then a creek that runs through with thousands of water dragons so tame they come up and just  kiss you. Would you like to live there.

 Okay.

 Jeanne Villani does and we'll find out the secret of her open garden and give you the address so that you can go along today and tomorrow to see Waterfall Cottage which is a part of the open garden scheme all this and more because it is Saturday.



 Eight-triple-three-one-thousand one-eight-hundred-eight-hundred-seven-oh-two Suzanne's on the line in McMahon's Point and.

 Hello.

 How are you.

 I'm good thank you.

 You've got a big fat  Morton Bay fig.

 Well it's not that bit it's um it's about three feet 'cos I only know feet . About three feet high and um it's been doing so well my partner actually grew it from a seed we picked it up in a church garden  and our intention was to buy a house and plant it but we haven't got the house yet. So we've still got the fig and it's doing so well until recently. My um I think it's under stress God knows why  it's only on a balcony in a pot but it's getting a sort first of all I thought it was sunburn but the the leaves are getting oh um a pale ring and then after a while they crack . And  and then they break off first of all I thought oh golly it's a bug or something eating it. But no it seems to be happening as they're growing they're perfectly fine and then intermittently they get this it's it's as if somebody has um um put some hydrogen peroxide on them or something and then.

 Is there plenty of drainage in the pot.

 Yes uhuh um plenty I'm just wondering well obviously it's gotta come out of the pot and be planted in   a proper place but.

 You think it's a case of Free Willy it wants to just go into the  into the open.

 It does 'cos it's meant.

 I don't know Angus is that the case.

 Well the symptoms you describe um it it sounds could it possibly be water stress. Do you think the plant could be drying out from time to time.

 Yeah well it could be maybe I'm not giving it enough.

 Yeah they uh I mean they are a a rainforest tree that that's used to fairly constant moisture and and mulch y'know plenty of leaf mulch uh froh in the natural sort of environment um.

 Should I feed it some more. Ih feed it .

 Well I don't I wouldn't be so concerned about the feeding uh I mean what what you're in really is a sort of a holding operation.

 Yes that was the idea.

 So I think uh if you encourage more growth uh the plant's going to become uh more and more pot bound . Suh so I would be thinking about putting it into a uh a slightly larger container and just gradually moving it up a a container size every year.

 Which I we have been doing it's about  oh it would be about three and a half years old now . And uh God knows how we're going to get it out of this pot . Um I it reminds me of what happens to a gardenia when it hasn't got  when you need to give it Epsom salts.

 Right.

 That's that's the sort of thing that seems to be happening with it. W would it.

 So it's sort of a yellowing of the  the foliage gradually.

 Yes only in a certain area and then that uh pale part breaks.

 Right yeah yep is it in the older foliage that you're noticing that. Or the new growth.

 Wih uh no um  yes it is well it is in the older foliage but  I notice that with the new growth  it's starting to happen too.

 Yes well it yeah cih t obviously the a lack of nutrients would tend to make it pale off a bit but uh  uh perhaps you could just give it the occasional liquid feed. Uh one of the sorta complete liquid feeds that are on the market you can water that over the foliage and it will sorta feed those leaves 'n' 'n' keep them healthy  and I think just uh repotting it uh every year as you've been doing giving it a l bit more space um that's the way to go and they're pretty tough plants too so.

 I'd hate to be be responsible for anything bad happening to it.

 Yeah.

 So maybe I should find a park somewhere.

 Well that's that's yeah  they do need a lotta space  a park is a good option so.

 Mm mm.

 Well good luck with Suzanne.

 Okay thank you very much Simon love your show.

 Thanks for being on it.

 Thank you bye.

 The perplexing Morton Bay fig problem they are beautiful trees though how long do they take the ones that we see round town that are humungous.

 Mm.

 How long how old would they be roughly.

 Well you're looking at hundred  years plus those huge buttress roots and that kind of thing ih they're just uh extraordinary.

 And we've come to understand now that we should have lots of h h not hummus or tabouli but humus underneath the roots and uh those  uh the beautiful air breathing s almost  aerial roots.

 That's what they are exactly they're they're sort of support roots but they do like very well aerated conditions so grow them in a pot is quite feasible but uh they do like that constant moisture th that is provided by the humus that you mentioned Simon.

 And what about the um you know the the not ikebana the the the  bonsai-ing them can you bonsai them.

 Ah yes they make  fabulous bonsais.

 Maybe that would be Suzanne's option is to bonsai it.

 Well I c could be s recommended that's for sure.

 McMahon's Point she's right near North Sydney library she could wander up there and uh have a get a bonsai book out 'n' have her  portable  Morton Bay fig.

 I love it. Good bonsai with a bit of suiseki around the base.

 And a touch of wasabi bit of soya sauce  tastes beautiful.



 Ah Lisa's on the line in Cammeray you've got mutant gardenias from another planet Lisa.

  I have Simon good morning. Um I have some potted gardenias um which I've had for a while they we went away they dried out they were almost dead and I thought  trying to resurrect them I just cut them back until I found green.

 Mm.

 They've grown back. Beautifully.

 Good on you.

 But some of the leaves are enormous they're like sixteen centimetres long.

 Yes.

 Um but then others are normal size .

 Mm.

 Sixteen centimetres.

 Sixteen  it's true I had a witness yesterday we measured it just to make sure I wasn't going completely mad um but yes  I don't know why.

 Is it growing a little sort of like whip spike out of the centre and feet from the side.

  No no triffid um  attributes or anything it is just the the I mean the leaves I mean it's been attacked by a by a caterpillar as well which I've managed to pick off most of those and I've got those under control but the  new leaf growth is just amazing it's glossy there's nothing wrong with it it uh  I mean it's just sprouting everywhere but some of the leaves are just huge.

 Is that normal  for a gardenia Angus.

 Well I wouldn't say normal it uh but it plants will respond to to environmental conditions so it sounds like it's been on a very good paddock . If I could say that you've been uh obviously feeding it uh quite well by the sound of things.

 Well  look let me put it this way uh my green thumb is sort of uh more like a green fingertip  I'm not exactly um y'know terrific  in the garden I'm like I put in an effort  but I I just gave uh look I did um to resurrect them a little bit I put some Seasol on them to  to try and get ev y'know remuh mulch the soil that sort of thing  get them back on track and then a slow r release fertiliser buh buh but that was about it.

 Well that's uh that's the idea though with those slow release fertilisers they're  they the nutrients are always there for the plant and it's uh  yeah it's literally on a very good paddock uh but also light conditions can play a part as well um leaves will will respond to the environment and if there's a lower light level they can enlarge and and become a a darker green because there's more chlorophyll to catch the available light  that sort of thing. So is it in a shadier usually.

 Well actually I uh I h I have to really keep the water up to them because they it gets sun most of the time  but then by afternoon um we've got a sort of a m a mirella um sorta planted not far from it. I think it shadows the plant significantly in the afternoon I don't know if  if that makes a difference I mean like.

 Well it will.

 Yeah.

 Yeah I would suggest uh s the leaves are just uh trying to catch as much light as possible  um so I yeah I don't think it's anything to worry about sounds to me like uh.

It's saying thank you.

 It's saying thank you.

 I'm just .

 Might need to get it a personal trainer and wear off a bit  of that weight but part from that.

 I just think the flowers are gunna be amazing  when they cover my home.

 Yes yes we'd like to uh uh perhaps you could send some in for us.

 They'll be umbrella sized .

 I I'll remember that thanks very much.

 Thanks for that Lisa . Enjoy your weekend.

 You too bye-bye.

 Sixteen past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden guess what Angus  I have an orchid question for you next.



 Seventeen past nine and before we find out the orchid question Sally's on a mobile in Nowra. Hello Sally.

 Hi there.

 How are you.

 I'm good thank you  just travelling along.

 Heading south for a holiday.

 Yes  yes having a lovely time.

 Very nice now you've got elephant ears that are suffering.

 Yes look I I seem to manage to get them to grow really really well outside Sydney um and I know that they're meant they like sort of dark moist areas but I was hoping to be able to get a better result um I'm planning on y'know getting them to try and grow them in Sydney and I was just wondering for a bit of advice.

 Elephant ears we're  talking about a a tropical uf sub-tropical sort of plant there and uh what what they need is is warm as possible conditions. So yes they grow very well on place like thr the tropical islands of the pacific and so on so it's about understanding their environment I guess 'n' and giving them what they need. So yeah d deep rich sort of soil uh but a protected position near a uh a brick wall something like that where they can absorb a bit of extra heat in winter uh that'll that'll keep them going quite nicely.

 Okay I'll I'll give it a go if not I suppose a tropical island's in .

 You might just have to move to Fiji .

  That'd be fantastic thank you very much.

 Alright that's Angus's advice live in Fiji.

 Well Western Samoa would be my choice.

 Oh would it . Oh  there we go that's completely different let's go off to that orchid question now and Danny's on the line in Baulkham Hills how are you Danny.

 Good thank you.

 It's an orchid seed pod you need help with.

 Yeah I've got a well I've got quite a few Cymbidium madidums.

 Mhm.

 And I've got with uh several seed pods on it and I was just wondering when they ripen so that I can collect them and then get them uh see if they can I can get them growing.

 Right well they actually change colour as they mature so start off green and they actually sit on the plant for quite a few months while they mature but gradually they will will change to a brownish colour and eventually they'll split open but they're a bit tricky orchid uh growing orchids from seed because they have very minute microscopic seeds that uh unlike most plants theh there's very little food source in the seed and uh normally uh most orchids germinate uh in conjunction with a fungus uh that uh is a a beneficial fungus that that really sorta creates an artificial root system for the orchid while it's getting established so what uh m or professional growers do is is grow them in a sterile nutrient uh environment. So  we call it tissue culture.

 Yeah a nutrie uh a nutrient agar. Yep.

 Yes.

 I understand how they're grown it's it's just when to uh pick them and put them into the paper bags  so like I can um .

 Well normally what uh they do if if you're going to get them tissue cultured is is they harvest them a little bit before they're mature while theh they're still um green but fully uh fully formed so do you have uh have you got a contact in the orchid game that's going to say.

 Oh no I was going to develop that but um  ih I was just wondering what if you can give me a guide on what month like uh.

 Yep. Uh well they're d it generally takes quite a few months for them to mature so probably about four months or so after they form I'm just uh I'm not expert in this area but  it's around about that sort of time so you'll see the pod fully uh swollen uh uh uh when it stops sort of growing in size that's generally an indication that seeds are mature and then as they change colour that they're about to split open and uh. You can try and germinate them uh actually on some peat moss or something like that uh thah obviously that's how they grow in the in the wild uh by just normal germination. Um but but yeah that's uh only.

 So the nutrient uh agar's a a far more productive way of doing it.

 Well it is you just get a much higher percentage and  and uh better success rate. Mhm.

 Okay.

 Good luck with it Danny.

 Thank you.

 Thanks for phoning in the other orchids that I remember growing up with  and they used to be just on the rocks there are the rock orchids which is what Trevor in Carlingford would like to ask about am I right Trevor.

 You certainly are Simon.

 So you've got them or you'd like them.

 Well I've got access to some  I want to grow a whole lot more . A lot lot more . In which case I'd like to grow them from seed.

 Yep yep.

 I want to know what the seed looks like where it is and how do I propagate it.

 For  sure the Sydney rock orchid Dendrobium speciosum.

 That's me animal.

 Yes they're uh they're actually a lithophyte meaning they they.

 No need to be rude.

  They grow in rocks and uh look they're a spring flowering plant and then the pods form on the uh spent flower so again it it takes several months for those pods to mature so you're actually coming into sort of summer autumn when they're maturing. So it's a matter of finding a plant that that has set some seed and again uh the the advice is they're they're very uh the seed is dust-like in character so  commercially they're they're propagated in tissue culture and on that nutrient agar we were just mentioning and uh ih that's one way of doing it uh the other way I suppose would just be to if you've got an appropriate sort of environment um if you've haven't got any natural rocks in the backyard you could you could bring in some large rocks. Uh bearing in mind that uh we don't wanna be plundering the bush for our uh our rock features. But uh if you can locate some some large sized rocks um I guess how they grow naturally is the those dust-like seeds are distributed on the rocks 'n' and uh protected usually in a very protected environment shade from the trees and reasonably constant sort of moisture.

 Yeah I would someone told me to grow moss . On the rock and then put the seed on the moss and I just   I've grown dehn well I've had Dendrobiums growing for years and I've never gr seen anything that w could recognise as a seed that was all.

 Yes yeah well that's uh probably 'cos they're so microscopic you you actually they're they're like specks of dust so you really uh if you get one of the seed pods and uh split it open you'll find it contains tens of thousands of of individual seeds so it's it's really a matter of catching the pod uh as it's ripening and um y you can actually put it into a paper bag and and you collect all that seed.

 In the paper bag and then  what you sprinkle the paper bag over the moss or.

 Yeah well what uh what you could do is get a seed tray put some uh sphagnum moss in that and then uh put the seed much as like is done with ferns spores  where uh yeah you get a seed tray and then put a sheet of glass over the top to to uh keep the humih humidity up while the seeds are germinating. And um yeah that that will give you generally a a higher success rate.

 Well that sounds excellent thank you very much and just as a little aside.

 Yes.

  tree that I got from you at the open day at the tip is now two metres tall.

 Yes.

 And I've just uh repotted thirty cuttings I took off it last year and they're all doing well and I thank you very much.

 Terrific.

 Wow thirty-one trees from thirty threes from one.

 Yeah good value isn't it.

 Yes.

  .

 This is what we like to hear Trevor.

 That's great Trevor.

 See you later.

 Have a great day.

 Cheers.

 Twenty-five past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney.



 Ah this is seven-oh-two A B C Sydney Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden and very shortly we're also going to find out about Waterfall Cottage Jeanne Villani has been tending this and it's an amazing garden many areas of uh ur set around a creek the waterfall plunges into this beautiful pool and the house and the creek goes down through the property and it's part of the open garden scheme I think for four or five dollars or uh y'know you get to wander around the garden take a picnic 'cos it's enough to do that and also uh see all the water dragons we'll meet Jeanne Villani and give you the address in the next half hour twenty-six minutes past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney a fine sunny day top temperatures on the coast of twenty-seven degrees thirty degrees inland and the outlook for tomorrow fine and sunny with some westerly winds starting ahead of a change and it'll be raining on Monday and Tuesday. Gillian's been waiting very patiently at Wyong Creek how are you Gillian.

 I'm good thanks Simon how are you.

 Very well you wanna propagate a melaleuca.

 Yeah um I've got a question for Angus  um I've tried propagating from my Melaleuca viridiflora a couple of times and um all I seem to get are some dead sticks . And I was hoping Angus might be able to give me a few pointers as to when is the best time to do it.

 Yep.

 Um  the other thing is that the trees I'm propagating from they're not fully matured trees . I don't know if that's got something to do with it or not y'know.

 Oh no that would help if anything uh so have you tried propagating by seed.

 No.

 Because  that's a I think probably the easier option.

 The reason I haven't done that is because I've been told  I don't know if it's true that if I propagate from seed they will revert back to the cream coloured flower not the red flower.

 Okay yep yep sure that  is a possibility.

 I really wanted the red flower.

 Yep yep  okay yes alright yeah cuttings are definitely an option. And what I'd be looking at is is taking cuttings uh at what's called a semi-hardwood stage which is uh ab around about now in fact.

 Mhm.

 So what you're looking for uh are the tips of the branches where the leaves have have started to or well have fully expanded um but the s the stem hasn't gone perhaps as woody as as um  as it will.

 Yep mhm.

  So what uh really ab over the next couple of months is is a good time to be trying uh and I'd be looking at a cutting say about ten to fifteen centimetres long . And removing the bottom uh few leaves  and then uh I'd be trying one of the uh the rooting hormones  that you can get which are um you dip the end of the cutting in a  and uh and then I guess ah just just putting into a a m a relatively sheltered environment if  if you don't have a propagation house.

 No I don't no.

 Yeah yeah um but I find a a sheltered sort of uh deck or something like  that where it's not getting blasting hot sun or wind and that sort of thing  will keep it c uh keep it pretty happy . And uh a good well drained buh you can get specialist propagation mixes based  on coarse sand or perlite that sort of thing.

 And they're alright for natives.

 They're great f yes  perfect for uh for natives.

 Okay.

 And uh yeah that's I think uh will maximise your chances of success.

 Alright well thanks for that advice Angus.

 Yeah.

 I'll give it a go.

 Alright.

 And it it is worth trying from seed though even though you're not  guaranteed.

 Yeah that's true yeah yeah it's worth it. I might get . 

 Uh  yes if the plants are growing in isolation uh if you've only got the red flowered form uh and they're pollinating each other then uh there's a very good chance the seed will come true to type.

 Yep okay yeah alright.

 Thanks Gillian.

 Thanks a lot okay bye.

 There we go Gillian and her melaleucas at twenty-nine minutes past nine on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney couple of gardening events from Simone's What's On include the Luddenham Show which is on today and tomorrow it's like the old fashioned show y'know the  produce show bit like Picton Saint Ives those sort of shows. Luddenham Show's today and tomorrow uh at uh corner of Park Road and Campbell Street in Luddenham and also the Blackheath Flower and Craft Show now Angus has been telling me about the Blue Mountains Dahlia Championship and let me tell you that is  a tense event it really is. Um.

 Look there's there's nothing like a cactus dahlia to to really get you.

 Ah mate.

 Get you going.

 And and the amount of work they go through do they still drug test at the uh Dahlia cuh Championship.

 They do  yes yes steroids are a common  issue these days.

 Ih l also be vegetables pot plants floral uh arrangements and all sorts of things that's at the Blackheath Flower and Craft Show it's the seventy-eighth one and I think it's children free three bucks to get in ten till three-thirty uh also another event on today is the Cattai National Park Discovery Walk aln  the Hawkesbury River and along the clifftop Cattai visitors centre and tomorrow the Cumberland State Forest which is a fantastic little oasis in the  heart of the hills  Cumberland State Forest Castle Hill Road West Pennant Hills they're doing a bush tucker walk where the rangers will take you through the bush you'll get to identify edible food and then you'll have a tasting as well I think adults are about three bucks children two bucks but you do need to book and the phone number for that nine-eight-seven-one-double-three-double-seven nine-eight-seven-one-double-three-double-seven and of course our open garden scheme garden which we'll talk about in the next half hour but with a fine day ahead of us let's find out what's happening in news headlines and good morning to John Hall.



 Thanks for that John and of course after the news at ten the Weekend Woodies resume their do it yourself home renovation and has Les managed to fix the horrible piece of mutilated timber that I gave him last week after I tried to make a shelf we'll find out about that tool of the week and a boofhead as well so that's stay with the weekend show.



 Right now Angus Stewart taking your calls in the garden and Colleen's on the line in The Entrance how are you Colleen.

 I'm very well thank you how are you.

 Very well but your agapanthus aren't.

 No very sick  very sick . Yes they've got a white powder sort of stuff all over them and the leaves turn crinkly and yellow and die  and it all goes to sorta jelly.

 Mm.

 Mm.

 Right it sounds they're uh one of the world's toughest um   plants the agapanthus. What sort of conditions is it uh growing in.

 Well they've been there for years doing fine um  they're ou um plenty of light 'n' um just I don't know up the backyard in the garden.

 Yep yep so they're not uh yes I mildew  ih ih so you can rub th off this white  substance.

 And it goes right down into the to the uh centre of the plant.

 Mhm.

 Mm.

 Mkay  so it's not a insect or anything like that.

 No no no no.

 It s it sounds like a fungus yeah. Wuh yeah I've don't I've never struck agapanthus getting a powdery mildew or downy mildew but uh  I I guess it's it's uh it may be possible uh I guess fungicide would be uh indicated if if it is a fungus.

 Yeah.

 Um so.

  is it.

 I guess yeah without seeing it I I c I'd be inclined to recommend that you take a sample along to to your local garden centre 'n'.

 Yeah I I did think that yes.

 And get them to have a look at it  and um ih if they've got a good horticulturalist there they'll be able tell you whether it's fungal and and um recommend a a suitable fungicide. Uh if it is powdery mildew something like one of the sulfur based fungicides would would be uh indicated . But uh I'd I.

 And also with the local ones they'd know what was happening in the area too wouldn't they.

 Yes yeah but it's.

 Yes and I've got a good one at over at Ourimbah a big t  All Seasons nursery over there I think I'll take one s plants over there might be me b best shot.

 Would be a good idea I think  to get a a a visual ala .

 And they don't mind if you walk in  and say can I h can I have the orh the y'know the horticulturalists they sort of.

 I'm sure they'd be.

 They'd be happy to do that.

 Yes.

 Amenable but uh.

 In the yeah.

 Yeah.

 . It's worth a try because I've a loh I've got a lot of agapanthus.

 Yes it's unusual to to um hear of them having problems like that are they uh have they been divided up.

 No not recently no .

 'Cos that can sometimes be a an issue with clumping plants like that as they get older uh the the clumps tend to sort of ih.

 W what's happened is some of the seeds have come off 'n' and um y'know grown again and even the younger plants have got it.

 Mhm mhm.

 As well as the older ones mm.

 Yeah but if the clump is very sort of tight uh sometimes dividing in them up can reinvigorate them 'n' and uh so if you dig up an old clump and and just uh uh split it gih give it a bit more sort of room to move  uh it starts to grow vigorously again and uh with something like agapanthus I would think it would would would be able to grow through a problem like that . So that I would suggest be another strategy you could employ.

 Okay then well uh  try all those and see what happens.

 Yeah.

 Alright Colleen.

 Okay then good thanks very much.

 Good luck  twenty-four minutes away from ten on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney.



 Two incidents causing problems today uh are at the moment there is an accident involving a car and a truck at Lane Cove West that's on Epping Road at Mowbray Road one of three westbound lanes are closed with moderate delays there and also Lidcombe Parramatta Road between Hill Road and Birnie Avenue. One of two eastbound lanes closed uh not as sh many delays there but eastbound traffic affected by that one twenty-three minutes away from ten.



 We've just had somebody ring in to say that uh it could be mealy bug on the agapanthus.

 Wh mealy uh I mean I did did uh ask Colleen about insects uh mealy bug can actually look like uh a fungus uh because it it has that sorta white uh cottony appearance. So that's why I think it'd be good idea to get a a second opinion at a g uh someone who can look at .

 Hop along to the horticulturalist at the garden centre.

 Yeah yes if it is mealy bug then uh obviously it will need an entirely different treatment to a uh fungicide. It'll need an insecticide uh or you can wipe wipe them off and uh go down that road uh but uh it's it's a very nasty problem the mealy bug one and I'd be seeking help.



 Very shortly Jeanne Villani to talk about her open garden but first of all on the line is uh Lynne in Engadine how are you Lynne.



 Ah Lynne's playing the piano. Hang on .



 Yeah no that's very good Lynne . Isn't that nice.

 Is that Rachmaninoff.

 Ah it's rack something off but there we go at twenty-two minutes away from ten on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney Bernie's on the line in Crow's Nest Bernie can you play the piano for us as well.

 Uh no I can't  my little boy can.

 Oh can he.

 Yeah .

 It's alright honestly . You wanna r move a satin ash.

 Yeah a Windsor satin ash   Syzygium dansiei.

 Mhm.

 Just uh it's about one and a half metres high.

 Yeah.

 Yeah.

 Um it's been planted for about eighteen months just wanting to know if it's okay to to move it.

 Well they can be a bit tricky. Uh wuh uh I mean any evergreen plant that that is getting to that sort of size but look uh yes Syzygiums or lilly pillies are one of the more amenable plants to  to being pruned and then uh regrowing and and I think that's the key to transplanting uh evergreen plants when they uh the the biggest problem with them is water stress so if they've got a lot of uh leafy growth as lilly pillies tend to do then it creates a lot of water stress on the plant if you damage the root system when you move it. So what I would suggest is if you have no option but to move it is to to trim it back by about a third  and uh obviously take as big a root ball as possible but but uh giving it maximum protection when it's uh been moved. There are some commercial products that that you can spray onto the leaves to to limit the water loss um and uh really waiting until the weather cools down as well and the plant goes into a sort of a a uh semi-dormancy . Uh all those things will will maximise your chances of success  and it it should be possible a metre and a half it it's getting to the limit of uh where it's a a feasible idea but uh I think it's definitely not impossible.

 Yep yep.

 Mm.

 Righto.

 Alright thank you very much.

 Thanks Bernie.

 Righto.

 Let's see if Lynne's still playing the piano.



 That's beautiful isn't it.

 It is.

 Who would think Saturday morning's the best time just to sit listen to the radio  play a little bit of piano.

 Perhaps she's . Perhaps she's playing it to her um to her plant.

 Well she's got a cycad that's giving birth so maybe she's just playing the cycad soothing music in the nursery.

 Indeed.

 Good on you Lynne.

 Perhaps it's still in the maternity ward.

 Uh that could well be the question uh uh William's on the line in Artarmon hello William.

 G'day Simon how are you.

 Very well.

 The shot. My question relates to mwah to tomatoes and rhubarb.

 Right.

 Last year we had a terrific crop of rhuba of uh tomatoes . And uh this year some wild tomato bushes have come up in the compost as a result of the compost . In the interim we planted nine um bushes of rhubarb . We had two uh meals off them . And now six of them have died is there any uh opposition to growing op uh rhubarb near tomatoes.

 Will tomatoes pick on rhubarb .

 Oh I wouldn't have thought so the the sort of issues uh you're looking at with uh vegetables are uh it's crop rotation plants of the same family do tend to get similar diseases so y'know tomatoes and capsicums things like that they're  very closely related.

 I see mm.

 But uh tomatoes and rhubarb are that's they're a long way apart botanically so I wouldn't think there would be any link between.

 Want to give the game away if I can't grow rhubarb.

  Well it's a c could be a number of of factors. Ih uh.

 I know that from the provedores the fruit and veg guy the two things that have been causing problems this year have been rhubarb and tomatoes for the uh  commercial growers.

 Go on go on.

 So the wet weather the heat the wet weather the heat  have caused problems for particularly roma and those sort of  tomatoes . And uh rhubarb's been tricky as well.

 Ours apollo tomatoes and they've been a terrific crop but we just had to change them to another bed this year.

 Right.

 Yes yeah.

  mm.

 Yes you've done the the right things there but certainly the the sort of conditions that that Simon's describing uh we've had in Sydney as well and ih it it does tend to predispose plants to root rots.

 Uh would you suggest uh replanting rhubarb with new crop new.

 Yes but doing it in a different spot.

 In a different spot.

 Yes yeah.

 Okay  right.

 Good on you William nothing like fresh rhubarb is there.

 Enjoy your program.

 Thanks for being on it.

 Good on you mate.

 It is seventeen from ten a little musical interlude from Lynne.



 It's beautiful .



 No one's ever done that to me before rung up and played the piano to me.

  Yes.

 I feel I feel pressured uh precious and treasured.

 What about her cycad. This must get.

 Well the cycad  very peaceful. Let's.

 Twenty-four hours a day by the.

 Open the playschool window and see who's got their open garden this weekend.



 Jeanne Villani you play the piano as well don't you.

 No I don't I don't have time I'm too busy gardening.

 I know 'cos the uh the size of of Waterfall Cottage how big's the actual garden.

 Uh oh probably  three acres I would think of the eight acres the property. It it's hard to know because it sort of one blends into the other.

 And it's in Bayview you get a lot of the sort of the the protection and rainforest around there from this beautiful gully isn't it.

 Yes yes it's um sort of a bit cooler down here than it is in the outside world.

 The uh there's several different rooms we follow the gully down but you've got areas going off with a dovecot and palms and that sort of thing describe if I was to walk around the garden what would I see.

 Well at the moment you'd see a lot of purple plectranthus because um it's a  it's a it's a plant that's very hard to uh sorry very easy to uh take cuttings from and uh so I've got a lot of it and it looks absolutely wonderful there's just big purple drifts. The other thing that's uh looking particularly good at the moment is uh are the gingers and the bat plant's in flower.

 Oh the bat plants are spectacular.

 Yes. Yes and all the rainforest trees are now growing th that I planted to extend the rainflorist  forest belt. Um to protect the house um. Should the fires come . Um  they're all growing now so uh yes they're all different sort of areas.

 You've retained a lot of the natural uh vegetation there too Jeanne  haven't you.

 Yes yes there's a lot of uh large rainforest trees and then it uh goes off into the bush and uh  plus the wildlife so uh.

 The wildlife you mean the water dragons.

 Well no uh  they're they're no trouble because they eat the slugs and snails they're wonderful but uh  once the drought was over the wallabies weren't so bad eating all the uh all the buds on plants but uh now there's a family of brush turkeys have moved in and they're uh relocating the mulch and uh  and some of the plants too while the uh while they're about it.

 Have you got any tips on dealing with a uh malicious brush turkey  Jeanne.

 Ooh basting in a slow oven for four hours isn't it.

  They they look as though they'd be a bit tough.

  Now also around there are lots of ponds and indeed is the waterfall running.

 Uh no it's stopped uh again because it hasn't rained since uh oh which was the day when we had all the heavy rain Wednesday I think . And it hasn't rained since then and it goes underground but um  uh further down the creek it's running but it actually over the edge of the waterfall ih it isn't running at the moment unfortunately.

 Now I believe also that somebody works very hard cuh making all sorts of beautiful comestibles and teas.

 Mm  yeah they're all ready all I've gotta do is uh cut up the cake and uh we're ready to go.

 And what is Jeanne's cake this weekend.

 Oh well it's lemon muffins and brownies and carrot cake.

 Oh yum.

 And have you got any lemon myrtle tea to go with it Jeanne.

 No lemon and ginger tea .

 Terrific or you need  some of those um.

 I could go and pick some lemon myrtle leaves and uh.

 You've got a lemon myrtle bush there.

 Oh yes yeah.

 So people can have a look at that as well I always get the address wrong so give us to us again.

 Ninety.

 Yep.

 Cabbage Tree Road Bayview.

 Ninety Cabbage Tree Road Bayview which of course is on the northern beaches.

 Yes.

 Turn left at um  Avalon. Am I right.

 No no no no no.

 No.

 No  um if you're coming down Mona Vale Road you turn left before you get into Mona Vale.

 That's right.

 Yeah.

 Yes uh.

 No no don't go as far as Avalon  unless you're coming from Palm Beach .

 That's right . So turn left at Mona Vale and it's ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview today and tomorrow Jeanne.

 That's right yeah.

 And from oh in about twelve minutes time.

 Yes ten till four-thirty.

 We'll let you get into it and w how much are you charging for to go in.

 Uh five dollars fifty for adults and children are free.

 And uh bring in uh suh uh suh a blanket to sit on 'cos it's a beautiful big garden. Have a great weekend.

 Well there are lots of seats.

 Lots of seats.

 Yes  they don't have to sit on the ground.

 Alright Jeanne have a great weekend.

 Good thanks Simon.

 There we go Jeanne Villani there and the address is ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview and a most impressive garden and uh you can see the lemon myrtle and maybe see the brush turkeys as well twelve minutes away from ten on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney the Weekend Show Angus there taking your calls and if you'd like to ask a question for the Woodies they're along after ten o'clock as well.



 Now uh let's just  hear a little bit no it's not there anymore let's see whether uh Beth wants to take Lynne's place do you Beth.

 I do indeed thank you so much .

 Playing piano or um.

 Definitely not no no.

 You've got a cycad question.

 I have a cycad question I hope it's the same question as  as the other lady's and it helps her out too. I had a magnificent old cycad   that has been in my care for about fifteen years and um it appeared to go to cycad heaven. And it was it's in a pot  and I simply left it and um  when it's rained it's rained and uh it's probably been I thought dead but we'll say dormant for  at least twelve months  . And in the last month or so it's had um a number of little cycads appear all around the edge of it . A mass masses of them . My question is um it's in a pot there's not there's really not very much room around those edges . Are these  little ones are they independent plants and can I separate them or are they part of the assumed deceased cycad.

 Uh yes  yeah.

 Can I separate them can I do something 'cos they will not last in the pot the way they are.

 Yes you can they are uh little vegetative um buds that are sprouting at the base there sometimes called pups   and uh yes yeah they c they will uh gradually develop a an independent or root system of their own  which enables you to to split them off and pot them up.

 Right.

 So  when do you know is the right time to do that Angus.

 Well it's uh I'd I'd wait for the sorta cooler weather but but also you'll see uh if you dig actually try 'n' uh uh lift one out whether it's it's got a bit of a a root system at the base.

 Right.

 So I'd be guided by the the plants themselves  just uh there's a a lot of them you might just have a scratch around one 'n' 'n' see when it's uh starting to develop a r a reasonable little root system of its own.

 Okay well there certainly are a lot of them .  I've I thought it was my my personal backyard phoenix.

 Ah.

 . It sounds like it.

 Oh it's been it's been a nice surprise.

 Yeah.

 I was pretty ashamed of myself letting it die .

 Well there you haven't let it die. Obviously  if you've um you've nurtured it um.

  It's come back alright.

 Uh what sort of music have you been playing it just out of interest  to get that sort of result.

 Uh it gets the regular sounds of dogs barking and chooks cackling.

 Oh  yeah well maybe piano'll help .

 I thought  a bit of A C D C but it'd have to be.

 A C D C for the cycads .

 Bon Scott variety .

 Can ih can I ask one other very quick question.

 Yep.

 At what point is it too late to try to transplant a potted citrus. Where do you give up and just go buy a new one.

  Well  I think that this is true of all woody plants they they can get root-bound  and and that's the uh the biggest issue. So really I'd I'd be guided by the the appearance of the root system. When you take it outta the pot if you see a lotta roots curling around the bottom uh really to me to get a decent sort of citrus tree y you're going to have to perform drastic surgery to cut off all of those um sorta curled roots  and uh prune the top of the plant to to compensate for that  uh you you can resuscitate them and uh I would say it's a kill or cure sort of  situation  and if you kill it well  g that's the time to go and buy an other one but.

  But it.

 It's sad already so.

 They are very resilient uh plants though  citrus uh but if you do sort of go down that route of uh the drastic prune of the roots and the top uh watch out for suckers coming from the rootstock  uh at the base of the plant it'll sometimes induce those and you've just gotta uh knock those off with  your fingers.

 Mhm.

 But it it would be worth a try I would say to r to resuscitate it  but um.

 Again leave it leave it until a bit later on in the year.

 Yes yeah I'd autumn really is  the perfect time.

 Okay terrific.

 Yeah.

 Alright.

 Got a few tasks to do thank you so much.

 Good on you  Beth bye-bye.

 Let's see what uh Lynne's playing nowadays.

 .

 Ah you're not playing the piano anymore.

  Oh Simon look I'm sorry  .

 Don't be sorry it was it was a lovely interlude. You've  obviously practised that tune for a while. 

 I know you're culturally appreciative so I thought that might've been nice little interlude sorry about that my bad manners.

 It was b   but I think we might have answered your cycad question.

 Well mine's just it's about thirty years old and it's huge about nearly a metre and a half high  and all of a sudden we've got a baby at the bottom of it.

 Mhm.

 A pup.

 Yes.

 That's what they're called.

 A pup.

 A pup.

 A pup of cycad.

 There we go.

 Okay so what what do I do.

 Yeah uh well I think just just wait to to the for the cooler weather and and you can actually just excise that from the plant . Uh provided it's got a a few new little roots of its own  and pot it up into a uh and put it in a protected sorta position and uh with a bit of luck it it will just uh grow into a it's own independent plant.

 Good.

 And the music  that Lynne should play to it you say A C D C.

 Well I've always had good success with with uh the Bon Scott A C D C type but obviously piano is is good too.

 Working a treat . Good on you Lynne.

 It's  underrated I think music and  plants.

  Bye.

 Six minutes away from ten which means it's uh less than uh ten minutes away from the Woodies and on the line we have Jack in Concord how are you Jack.

 Uh good morning. Uh look I have um about sixteen golden diosma.

 Yep.

 They're the dwarf ones.

 Yes.

 And they've been here for about two years  and they've been going quite well . But in the last say two months I've lost three of them . They've just uh dried up uh or  or something's happened to them and they're just dying.

 Okay so you seeing anything on the tops that  insect damage or fungal growth anything like that.

 No there doesn't seem to be anything wrong they were  going quite well . And then all of a sudden they just started to go brown . Uh lost their uh green and they've just dried up.

 Mm mm or lost their gold in this case.

 Yes.

 Uh but look there's a couple of possibilities I can think of. The golden diosma ih it actually belongs to the citrus family believe it or not um Rutaceae  and uh they can be a little bit susceptible to to rootrots uh and the weather we've been having would would uh with the humidity and so on would uh perhaps predispose the plants to something like phytophthora or rhizoctania one of the fungal root rots  uh so you could try something like uh Anti Rot on the plants that are are remaining to boost their sort of immunity to root rots if that's what it is but what I would be doing is is pulling up the the dead ones  and having a a look at their root systems uh because the other thing that's starting to uh come into play at the moment is uh curl grub uh curl grubs the larvae of the uh African black beetles.

 A few people weeding go isn't that cute I've got a witchetty grub in my garden but it's not is it.

 No they're well usually they're they're uh curl grubs or something similar which are feeding on the root system. And uh that can uh damage the plant in itself and it can also provide an entry site for these rootrots so I'd be digging up the dead ones and and having a look at their root systems if you can find any of those curl grubs you'll uh might need to take preventative action to to save the other  fifteen  golden diosmas.

 How do you get rid of the uh curl grub.

 Well there are various chemical treatments you can use um I guess that's probably the there is uh also a uh a nematode beneficial nematode that is available  for home gardeners that you can water in it's a microscopic eelworm they're called but they they can actually get into the curl grub and and uh kill it uh uh in a a more natural sorta fashion.

 Yes well where they're growing uh like uh I had a natural garden along but  I dug those up and uh we had a lot of um oxalis growing . Now I had to get rid of that  so I sprayed it with um Roundup  nuh and then I covered it with um ah  uh uh um.

 Mulch.

 Gra brah uh grass mat . And then put pebbles on top . And uh but they've been going quite well up till uh and these three are all together.

 Yes.

 G y'know all the rest are good.

 Yep yep m well again that would tn tend to suggest something attacking the roots they couldn't have got a a whiff of the herbicide could they.

 Well I don't think so I I made  ev uh uh very sure about putting this Roundup on  I rung up their information bureau and they said it wouldn't hurt the uh soil at all  uh that's what their  uh reasoning was . So I just put the w I waited for a good few weeks  and uh y'know before I planted them.

 Yes no should be okay yes I'd I'd be looking at the the curl grubs and the the root rot question.

 Alrightio.

 Yes I'll do that and find that out.

 Okay  good luck Jack.

 Ah and there was one other thing.

 Ooh we're outta time Jack 'cos the news is breathing down on us I might  get you to hold the line and if Angus is feeling in a good mood he might chat to you during the news. Can you hold on.

 Okay yeah.

 There we go and also Wally in coh in Neutral Bay hold the line we'll uh get you to the news time I'm just wanting to let you know that the address for the open garden scheme today Cabbage Tree uh Waterfall Cottage is ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview and uh that's right near Mona Vale on the northern beaches ninety Cabbage Tree Road in Bayview and Angus we'll see you in five weeks time I think on your home turf.

 Mm.

 I might be broadcasting from the studios of ninety-two-point-five in Erina so uh we'll see you up on the coast .

 On my own dung hill   say.

 And uh luke look forward to using the compost toilet or something like that.

 Well I'll bring in some uh some worm uh droppings for you.

 What are the  things we put in worm farms apart from garden kitchen waste I've put in torn up cardboard.

 Yes uh straw  uh just sort of old old uh lawn clippings that have dried out  that sort of thing will will open it out and get some oxygen in to to help the worms along.

 Oh that's what I need to do is to help the worms. The Weekend Woodies are up next speaking of worms and they'll be taking your calls on anything round the house that's causing problems and of course in Saturday Talkabout Tony Delroy is joined by Leo Compton and Jen Fleming to look back at the week on the wireless a fine day today top temperature on the coast of twenty-seven degrees thirty degrees inland but right now on seven-oh-two A B C Sydney it's news time ten o'clock.
