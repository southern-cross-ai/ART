" Mix one-oh-six-point-five We Did It All For Love of course the Love Line's open on one-three-hundred-double-eight-love. Love Song Dedications. We have a lady calling who needs to dedicate to her guy Terry. And you two have had some trouble what's happened.

 We've been fighting   fighting and fighting.

 Okay so a few sleepless nights for you there.

 Yeah yeah.

 Okay and er do you feel that it's stuff that you guys can work through.

 Ah hopefully we can it's just so frustrating.

 Frustrating and tiring and  emotionally exhausting huh.

 Exactly yeah and.

 That old rollercoaster.

 Exactly I just want him to know that weth even though I'm angry at him I really love him.

 You're just frustrated at the  situation at the moment yeah.

 Yeah like everything just blows up and then sometime he just disappears and doesn't doesn't come home y'know and.

 And that would cause you worry.

 Yes it does  yes it does yeah.

 Okay so you're just letting him know that you're just frustrated with the fighting and you'd like that to stop and you're prepared to do your bit to help.

 Yeah exactly yep  yup.

 How do you see you two in terms  of stopping the fighting.

 I just hope  that we comp compromise.

 Compromise.

 Yeah.

 Okay.

 And just understand each other a little bit more.

 Yeah yeah.

 Y'know what does he want and  what do I want.

 So look at each other's needs.

 Yeah  yeah  that's true yeah because when when I get angry I think he thinks that I hate him but I'm not . And when I get angry it's the fact is that I'm scared of losing him.

 Certainly yeah how.

 Do you understand that Richard.

 Yeah I do and  unfortunately when we get angry we say so many things that we regret  later.

 Like you say you say you hoon and then then you swear at each other  and  and all that yeah yeah.

 Okay well it's my pleasure to play Almost Here for your guy tonight and uh.

 Thank you very much Richard.

 I hope in some way this helps you to compromise and get to know each other's  needs hey and  understand each other better.

 Yep yep it will I hope it will.

 Thanks for sharing.

 Alright thank you. Terry this is for you and I do love you very much.



 Well Sophie's called to dedicate to Sam. And why are you feeling so blue tonight Sophie.

 Well we're not actually on good terms he really loves me and I love him and  we had to actually um be apart from each other due to religious problems and it's just he can't be with me due to um his family and stuff . And I'm just I really love him and I want him to know that.

 So how long since you two have seen each other.

 We've been together for three years . And um we've been apart now for about two weeks.

 Killing you.

 It's killing me and I guh uh I'm going through a very very rough time and   I don't know what to do to get him back and he just wants to be friends now just to see what to do but um I can't live without him and I want him back.

 So in a sense Sam has fallen into line with his family's wishes in terms of honouring the religious differences between you two.

 Yes.

 And he's chosen to.

 To stick with his family.

 Exclude himself from from your love.

 Yeah he ih he just doesn't want  he reckons he doesn't not wanna hurt me like later on if  if we keep dragging it but.

 Yeah what do y  what do make of this. Uh the religious differences breaking the love bond that you have.

 Yes it's a very strong love bond we've been through thick and thin with each other . But um I haven't got a choice I mean I h I respect his wishes and I want him to be happy I love him so whatever he decides I mean I'm just gunna have to live with but um I'm just hoping that he will think about it very very strongly and  he'll come back to me.

 That's your dream.

 Yes.

 I wish you well with that dream.

 Thank you.

 And in the meantime as we play a song for Sam is there anything else you'd like to get across to him.

 Just wanna tell him that I love him with all my heart and I'll never stop loving him. And I hope he can come back to me.

 No her brother.

 What what's her what's her brother doing.

 Oh just dunno just he doesn't want us together.

 Why  have you got a have you got a bad name or something Sadiq.

 No no it's just that he didn't like her having someone too close.

 Oh okay.

 'Cos I love her and she loves me I love her with all my heart. Really miss her.

 Y y you guys can't see a lot of each other because of this.

 Eileen what's on your mind tonight.

 Hi I just wanted to dedicate a song to someone very special in my life.

 Sounds good to me.

 Yeah .

 Just how special are we talking about.

 Very special.

 Mm a lifesaver do you think.

 Uh probably more than that. I just want him to know how much he means to me and um I hope we can just go seeriuh like further.

 Say four years ago when you two first started talking how were you feeling about life in those days.

 Before I met him I didn't know nothing I was just one of those people that um  didn't know nothing about love and  when he came into my life he taught me a lot and he put a meaning  behind the word love and um I love him so much for that.

 And now when you think of love you think of him.

 Yes. And l he's got a special place in my heart he'll always have that special place and I don't think anyone can can t take that place. He is he means the world to me and I love him so much.

 Is there anything else Eileen you'd like to get across to to Zaheer just before I dedicate Have You Ever to him.

 Uh I just wanted to sell  him that  I love him so much and  I hope he's safe wherever he is I'm not with him and I hope I can see him very soon to tell him how much I really care for him I think he knows that though.

  on Mix one-oh-six-point-five. Chris you've called to dedicate a song to Sarah.

 Yeah we had a bit of a breakup about six months ago so. Yeah trying to get back with her.

 So six months on from the breakup y your feelings haven't changed.

 Oh I've been feeling something's changed since we broke up.

 Have you talked to Sarah much in that time or have  you tended to just leave her alone.

 Try and talk to her every day yeah after work it's like we're still best of friends but.

 Yeah it's just not the same you haven't got  close contact that you had before.

 Yeah. Uh ever since we broke up six months ago I've just missed her.

 Yeah.

 I wanna get back with her because her son  uh her son hasn't got a father.

 Right.

 And I wanna be the father figure for her son.

 Yeah it's a horrible spot to be in isn't it hey.

 Yeah.

 What have your friends been telling you to do just let go.

 Oh let go but I just can't let go.

 Have you told Sarah that.

 Yeah I tell her every time every chance I've got.

 Yeah and is there a glimmer of hope there does she say anything that  gives you hope.

 She wants to give it a couple more weeks.

 Yeah so she hasn't gone off and given her heart to anyone else.

 No. 

 Okay and and do you look back and regret any of the things that you did that led to this you  do you feel it was just you or.

 Oh I used to be a really bad uh pot smoker . I quit smoking pot so  I think she's happy with that.

 Yeah yeah.

 'Cos really like it used to get real uh really bad . Used to smoke every day like wouldn't give a shit if I'd have  got drunk and fell over and cut myself she  just went really scared  and I cut it out . And started being normal.

 So you're just hoping that the change that you've pulled into your life and the fact that you're now caring for yourself  will translate into your lady your ex caring for you once again.

 Yeah. Just like c thought I'd go on radio 'cos I know she listens to this  like she listens to this all the time . Hoping it might she told me a couple of times that she was hoping to hear me on it one night.

" Freo Dockers skipper there Peter Bell hello everyone and welcome to Sports Today for Panasonic Ducted Air Conditioning and Craft Decor Adrian Anderson to join us from the A F L general manager of football operations tonight in his usual fortnightly segment and we were talking waffle for A H T with Harvey Deegan and the motor racing segment for Barbagallo Raceway with Andrew Van Leeuwen you can join us at any time nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two on the phone. Or if you'd like to email Barry checks it at every ad break. Sport at Six P R dot com dot A U as I ent I uh intuh introduced the said person hello Mr Barich how are you.

 Hey Barney how are you mate yeah.

 Jeez time goes fast doesn't it Belly playing his hundredth game for the Dockers.

 Yeah that's right uh.

 Doesn't seem like he's been back here that long does it  but it goes quick.

 Was it one game in nineteen-ninety-five.

 Long time ago.

 Yeah wuh was it ninety-five . Two games two games .

 Yeah one half and then another half.

 That's right and then  uh ninety-eight games when they had to pay a fortune to get him back . Hey tell me about uh Belly 'cos uh was interesting today  at the press conference uh uh the media quizzed him about y'know Connolly's uh decih decision not to let him play in the middle him 'n' c y'know uh Carr and uh Hasleby  and he let Gilmore go in there 'n' Dylan Smith 'n' how did you feel about it 'n' he refused to comment. Wouldn't talk about it just uh kept batting it away saying nah it's up to the coach uh it's coaching staff decision uh not gunna comment one way or the other whether I thought it was a good move or a bad move or how I felt about it uh  yeah I just thought that was thought that was pretty interesting uh.

 Well anything he's gunna offer's gunna be twisted so it doesn't matter.

 Yeah well maybe he took that view. Tell me about uh the.

 Like your mob did tonight I saw that.

 What'd they do.

 Did you oh you wouldn'ta had it over there because Terry Wallace talking to the did you is Seven running the story about  Terry Wallace ing bucketing the uh Telstra Dome surface.

 Oh yes yeah I got that on the list for Adrian Anderson.

 Well I well uh  I gotta say I gotta say I I saw him on Ten. Y'know 'n' and and no disrespect Barry to you and your friends at Channel Seven but on Ten he was concerned about yeah the Telstra Dome surface said it was a bit slippery but he was more concerned about his mid the centre four they can't get their hands on the ball and get it out of the middle that was a real problem for him. So what Channel Seven have done  y'know Wallace buckets Telstra Dome and they play the comment about the four players that he's got in the middle that he's he's ih that ih that they're hopeless at the moh it's not it's it's it's diabolical. That  'n' they played it on the back end of that uh  this is what the Telstra Dome is so you're not bad.

 That's Melbourne was it.

 Ah  yes it was.

 It musta been implied or something was it.

 Ah  you're good.

 Hey I'm not trying to dodh.

 You're good your blokes over here.

 I'm not tr I'm not trying to dodge the subject but uh.

 Yes you are you're going completely on a different path what're you talking about.

 Just going back to Peter Bell for a second . Hey mate I wuh there was a discussion at a function I was at uh the other day about uh.

 Another one.

 A-grade players and uh how many A-grade players Fremantle actually have and uh the consensus was they only have one. Would you agree with that I mean the people sh.

 Hmm certainly Pavlich's name comes to mind does it.

 Yeah Pavlich and that was it uh that uh perhaps Bell doesn't really enter into that category.

 Nah well if you if you wanna go into that d down that path I mean it's a very subjuctih shubjictive   question isn't it I mean you who who knows.

 Nah but the the bloke who was saying it was saying in the context of look don't be too hard on Fremantle have a look at Hawthorn they've got four  A-grade players y'know  they got Everitt Crawford they chucked he chucked Williams in there and Hodge which is debatable whether they got two or four but uh Fremantle  only has one.

 Where we're going down this little tangent is that we're ducking away that that Fremantle don't have the real talent.

 Mm y well that's what the case is being made yeah exactly.

 Oh okay okay uh uh yuh uh as another excuse or is that a reason.

 Well I dunno depeh  depends who's saying it  . Oh uh oh I deh eh I researched something have we got that audio there too uh Rob of uh this is ang just before I tell you about this uh.

 You love the audio.

 Tt I do I love audio 'cos y'know it's a it's an audio medium and.

 Saves you from speaking.

 It's right and uh it's it's m it's muhc encapsulated better by people  like Peter Bell talking about Polak and Dodd's suspension here's what he had to say first of all.



 Now the news out of Fremantle tonight was that uh Connolly spoke to th each player individually just about on the ground at training tonight uh there's no chance McPharlin or c Matt Carr will play they're miles away uh  and possibly Headland and I asked about the whole Polak situation and uh that basically the bottom line was they wanted to keep an eye on him. That's why they took him over they wanted to keep an eye on him because perhaps who knows what he'd get up to over here which is  y'know not a great thing to say I suppose.

 Ah you're kidding aren't you.

 But uh the other thing I found out is uh they all went and saw the Lion King too the all the boys 'n' the girl  girlfriends and wives and that too so . D'you reckon that'd fire them up.

 Ah yeah well it's fired me up.

 Dih d'you see the Lion King.

 Ah well tt no I haven't seen the Lion King.

 That'd be the singing and dancing.

 That's the one on stage.

 Yeah the stage.

 Yeah it's.

 What would that be like.

 Oh well if you like stage shows it'd be fantastic I'm sure.

 Yeah ih be ah be able to draw something outta that is it Simba was that Simba or.

 .

 Simba in that one.

 I prefer le Moulin Rouge.

  Is that why .

 I saw that in Las Vegas when I was there that was alright.

 What's the name of the lion in the uh Lion King it's not Simba is it that's  the White Lion. It was something else uh.

 Big Cat.

 No no no he's got 'n' the bad guy what's his name Tooth or Fang or something anyway we'll get we'll sort  it out. If you know uh wuh who's in the Lion King  give us a call  we've got footy tickets to give away too Barney again.

 Yes that's great thanks to Carlton Midstrength's fifth quarter helping you to stay a little longer this football season the Dockers's supporters were certainly leaving a couple of weeks ago.

 Yes it did leave a bit early 'n' there's been feedback about  . No people were saying that the reason like there was a bit of a uh a a poll on t one of the websites 'n' it the l most of people's reasoning was they were sending a message to the club . It was a good way to send a message by leaving early.

 Thank God for that I thought they must've run out of Carlton Midstrength.

 Yeah well that's right anyway we've got tickets to that elimination final virtual elimination final uh the Kangaroos versus the Dockers and uh and what about the cricket mate the empire struck  back. You told me.

 Ah well twen Twenty Twenty cricket is a absolute garbage mate at the international  level. And you know that I know that I think the punters know that I think it's got a its place in domestic cricket here in Australia I think it's not a bad idea I think it went very well didn't it down at the WACA. That night when we had it down there when the W A boys played the Bush Rangers. I think that went fantastic but at international level surely it's not right it is just not right.

 Uh well I know it's I know it's just hit and giggle but there were some  you gotta say there were some good signs there for the Poms. I mean  now what about their  their fielding even their fielding.

 They got McGilly out and they got Hayden out 'cos they went for the tonk.

 No but their fielding was actually uh had  gone up a level. And Darren.

 Yeah wuh th w yeah wuh that's that bloke look like a skunk what's his name.

 Oh c is it Collingwood  Bob . Yeah it's Collingwood isn't it.

 No Pietersen isn't it.

 No Pietersen yeah Pietersen's .

 H hasn't he got the m he  he's got the mullet like a skunk.

 Yeah he's the South African gun he was the bloke who went to the hairdresser's with Warnie. 'Cos they're mates in Hampshire d'you hear about that. 'N' they went to the hairdresser to have a cut and the hairdresser said hey Warnie you're going you're thinning out back here. And that's now Advanced Hair Yeah Yeah . Jeez  mate how good is Warnie . He's turned all his flaws into money . He's tuh he quit smoking for two-hundred grand  well didn't quit smoking but he said he'd quit . And uh now he's done the hair bit how much would he have got for that.

 Six figure sum.

 Oh it's just magnificent  isn't it and weight loss . Wait till Viagra kicks in down the track  when he's a bit older  he'll make a foll poultice outta that. Anyway you can't uh y'know he's a bit vain but you can't uh blame him I suppose we're all a  a bit that way. But anyway back to the cricket mate I Boof Lehmann great commentated first first up debut thought he was terrific  he's gunna be doing stuff on this station . Did you hear na.

 And Both.

 N n Both as well. Naf Nasser Hussain  and David Lloyd they've just fired up they ripped into the Aussies. Ih n Nasser Hussain at one stage said put your pads on McGrath you'll need them. Y'know like uh they're getting pretty cocky they're getting  pretty cocky  got a lotta emails and phone messages today.

 Absolutely nothing to d derive outta that I didn't think. Not a thing.

 What about uh the performance. The lion king is Mufasa . And  his son is Simba so yeah so I didn't say Simba though did I. Did I say Simba.

 I thought you said Kimba the White Lion   thinking about you've been watching too many cartoons.

 That was the cartoon Mufasa  we've had about three million calls thank you  we know it's Mufasa now and the bad guy was Fang I think . But if so you can't take I would like to hear from our listeners can we take anything outta that Twenty Twenty game cah should the Aussies  be a little bit concerned.

 Absolutely  zero.

 Nothing  nothing.

 You see some of the shots we played.

 It's got.

 They didn't wanna be there mate.

 Like seven for eight or something they got.

 They didn't wanna be there. And why would ya. I mean because look they used to have this real concern about uh guys playing in test match cricket the purists said well there are guys who play test match cricket who can't play one day cricket 'cos it affects their technique . Well what is Twenty Twenty cricket gunna do to your technique. I mean  the only one who's really suited to it is Gilly  because.

 Matt 'n' siv Simons.

 Ah yeah to a degree but yuh but Gilly plays with a long handle most of the time so it doesn't worry him. Hayden has had an absolute Barry Crocker over the past year or so and he's still playing same rash pool shots which ch gets the top edge and go about thirty-five-million miles in the air  and he gets caught forward of uh square leg y'know I mean ih th  it is not good for Matthew Hayden and it's not good for a lot of  other players. Y'know and when Jason Gillespie who is arguably one of the premier bowlers in the world  bowls four overs for forty-nine runs  what does that say about .

 I'll give you the tip Lee is definitely not suited to Twenty Twenty Lee  there's no doubt about it but uh well come on th I wanna be convinced by the listeners I mean do you think there's nothing to be taken outta that or is it is there a chance that the Poms are  up and running and that  they maybe they will challenge the Aussies.

 It should be restricted to the domestic competition here in Australia nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two if you'd like to put yourself in the running for those two tickets to Fremantle versus the Kangaroos on the weekend which we're dubbing the elimination final and you heard Belly he's sorta s concerned that uh he'd like to be winning a few more games and well it'd be a good game to get along to Peter Bell what of a great servant he's been for Fremantle his hundredth game coming up on the weekend for the club 'n' you got an opportunity go along by putting yourself in the running. Let's go to the phones hello Adrian at Duncraig

 Oh g'day guys how are you mate.

 Good.

 Hey look I'm an avid cricket follower and I actually stayed up to watch that game last night   and still managed to get to work this morning  and just a couple of points hurm uh  when they started 'n' they won the toss um the rr um uh who was it the captain of the English side y'know said that he was going in for a real dig  Rickie Ponting actually said y'know I hope people take it that it's a bit of fun and everything like that  and dead set it's two different approaches now if anyone says that that Australian side is gunna be absolutely um  um a bit uh threatened or tentative by that game last night they're they're they're a they're a joke. Now if you look.

 Hey you make  you do make a lotta sense is there anything we can take out of it though is there e like y'know maybe the Poms have improved in the field or  perhaps they will be a bit more competitive .

 The Poms have improved in the field I'll give 'em that from watching that game and I said I I watch a lotta cricket um they've improved in the field immensely right but the thing is you've gotta look at your bowlers right now those English bowlers I mean Darren Gough took three  he's not even playing for 'em mate   you've gotta you gotta sustain that.

 What about Jon Lewis who does midnight to dawn he uh he was brih  he was brilliant.

 But if you had a look at the balls that the Australians got out to right  it was just ih ih it wasn't I mean Glenn McGrath bowls more balls on line than the whole English team did right  it was just one of those games and dead set the Australians uh the the way they got out it was just like they didn't have an interest because Australia sets itself for the big games and for the Ashes and I'll tell you now England will not win a test they might win a few one-dayers but they will not win a test.

 Good on you   good on you Adrian appreciate you  starting us off to Parkwood hello Peter  oh.

 Peter of Parkwood.

 Hello Peter.

 Poyter .

 Mightta lost him. We'll go back to Peter see we can get him in a minute let's go down to Steve at Applecross.

 Yeah hi guys uh great show um just briefly on that Twenty Twenty game I think if it's a confidence game that's uh or confidence that's kept England down for these years  they'd have to take a little bit from it surely  I mean I know it's only Twenty Twenty it's all good fun everyone's stats go to hell but  yeah they get blown to blazes but I think um.

 It just meh it made the Aussies look human a bit Steve didn't it uh and theh  not like these unbeatable moh monsters that come over and just monster you.

 Yeah well especially after that um was it the county game or the first game where Lee took a wicket off the first ball I mean some people must've been thinking same old same old again . And they um their star South African got went for five or something but I mean uh yeah I think this has brought it back to an even keel 'n' I think we're we're back wandering again I think now it's um who knows.

 What about that ball that uh who's the opener Jones hit back  over Lee's head nearly killed him.

 Yeah  well he's  no fast bowler like that do they but  I mean  he might but Brett might remember that one for later I think though.

 Yeah  exactly.

 Good on you Steve  thanks for your thoughts mate we appreciate it to Quinns Rocks hello Tom.

 G'day how you going.

 Good.

 Hello.

 Yes Tom  fire away my friend.

 Yeah um just ringing to say that I agree with you about the Twenty Twenty I mean I think it's purely set up to make the batsman look good it completely kills the bowler's averages  and just just complete waste of time.

 They may as well not have bowlers I reckon they should just get one of those uh bowling machines up there and just hurl  'em down.

 Yeah just like that they have in baseball or something yeah just give the batsman a bit of practice I mean  that's all it seems to be.

 Well uh the the more tripe you bowl the more likely you are to get a wicket there you are. And and blokes who bowl line and length like McGrath and Gillespie and that and and even Lee I mean he y'know he bowls quick but jeez it just plays into your hands Barry you only have to get a nick and  see you later notice.

 Thah yuh thah.

 It still tah  a couple of hours  couple of overs to get going though doesn't it.

 Yeah it's a.

 That would explain John Lewis getting wickets I gotta  say 'cos how  bad was he he's just bolh tossing 'em up.

 To Roleystone g'day Ben.

 How you going Brad  a while ago I read somewhere on and heard you say that football was now boring let's have Twenty Twenty footy and let's see how better it is.

 Mm Twenty Twenty footy.

 Yeah  Twenty Twenty  footy y'know.

 How would you do that Ben.

 Easily.

 Yeah tell us how.

 Well  you get uh you got your twenty minutes.

 Mm.

 Uh the um everybody stays on the on the equator side or across the central line  and then you're into it just chuck the ball up in the air and away you go for  twenty minutes just slug it out.

 Like British British bulldog  at school or something.

 Yeah something like that a bit.

 Come on over.

 Yeah there's no  the day of tradition and uh truism and uh the the the skills of the game are fastly going and uh this Twenty Twenty cricket is a typical example of let's have a good time and don't worry about uh anything . Twenty Twenty football's  the coming thing.

 Made for T V Ben.

 Yeah.

 Good on you mate thanks very much mate um and and look what I said about boring about the footy was I was gr I was trying to um well not justify what Sam Newman had to say Barra 'cos y we know he got benched over here but he he did have a point and I mean anybody who watched the Hawthorn St Kilda game on the weekend could not have thought anything else than that that it was the worst game of football that you've ever seen because unfortunately some of the players are that robotic at the moment  they are that terrified they're gunna make a mistake they are that scrutinised that they think they're gunna get a clanger next to their name they are that frightened to kick the ball to a contest ih it's becoming by and large very embarrassing particularly from Hawthorn's point of view 'cos  y'know Maguire slipped down the field on uh on the weekend three times because he didn't have an opponent 'cos Hawthorn had that many behind the ball it wasn't funny so even when they won it they had a succession of possessions and that's why Crawford tt 'n' Mitchell 'n' ih Smith and all of these guys racked up y'know thirty-plus possessions and when they went to kick the ball down the ground there was young Mark Williams and four St Kilda defenders . And guess what happened . The poor kid got slaughtered. You know and the ball came back down the other end Fraser Gehrig was fantastic missed a few but y'know they just whipped the ball into their forward line and kicked to score. Now  if that's good footy uh I'm not here buh so so I understand 'cos I know Ben's a real grassroots man 'n' 'n' so am I but I just wanted to make that point that I think Sam Newman had a bit of a point  because it not only about Hawthorn there have been other games and.

 Wuh d what did you make of the um Geelong Adelaide game then d'you you know Adelaide had a hundred-and-eighty-seven handballs. Some sort of A F L  record it's sih like sixty more handballs than a than you would have in a normal game and uh yeah I mean it was c exciting at the end there but gee Matty Scarlett was sensational but gee  that's a lotta hanh it was like rugby wasn't it  more ha more handballs than kicks.

 Oh yeah it was crazy. Nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two we'll take your calls if you wanna go and see Belly's one hundredth game for the Freo Dockers on Sunday they play the Kangaroos be the best talkback caller tonight nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two Adrian Anderson'll join us after the break here on Sports Today.



 Yes didn't Nasser Hussain love that Barra and uh huh  he hah  not bad for a captain who's got a record of four from about fifty-six  um.

 Get your  get your pads on  Glen McGrath.

 And as we go to.

 Go 'n' get nicked Nasser Hus .

 Least he's won something  uh to Glendalough hello Andrew.

 What about the 'n' um Pommy commentator who said smashing smashing .

 Yeah he was he wuh  he was barracking.

 I luh I listened to the radio after that. I couldn't handle that anymore.

 What'd how'd they finish that's uh end of story start the car . Oh give us a break.

 Who was that commentator guys.

 David.

 I think I think it might've been the same bloke who broadcast the Kostya Tszyu Ricky Hatton fight.

 Oh he was a moron  anyway.

 Dave it was David ih.

 Why has it got boundary ropes.

 Well I woulda sworn that theh wuh when the the day that Tszyu fought there was only one bloke in the ring.

 David  David Lloyd  was the uh David Lloyd was the bloke with Boof I'm surprised Boof didn't shin him and uh  Nasser Hussain was down  on the boundary talking absolute Swahili I'll tell ya .

 When the real stuff comes on and they beat us in a test I'll be uh tip my hat to 'em but this Twenty Twenty is just a lot b like winning the raffle innit.

 Yeah  I suppose.

 Exactly.

 But  they did loo they did look better.

 Why has it got boundary ropes in the grounds at England aren't they small enough without boundary ropes.

 Mm. That's.

 Like y'know you 'n' me could just about top one over the top.

 I think you're right    they were saying it was gunna go rows back 'n' it went about three rows back 'n' theh and it was the the the boundary line was less than fifty metres from the centre of the wicket I reckon .

 And so how're Bangladesh gunna go against uh Australia 'n' England at Twenty Twenty cricket.

  Well that's what they suh that's what they said . They said if England can beat Bangladesh they're genuine contenders .

 Someone's rang through mate and said the the Kostya bloke was Ian Darke is it Darke and uh David Lloyd was the one last night said that  a man who coached an England side that was pumped three-one by Australia in nineteen-eighty-nine ninety-nine series.

 Yeah I think Ian Darke was one of 'em but there was another bloke who just never shut up through the Kostya Tszyu fight 'n' every time that uh Kostya landed a punch he forget to say that he did. Tt .

 Hey mate just on that just  before we move off boxing moight .

 Boxing moight .

 Moight  what's going on moight  uh last week we spurkt spoke to Fenech 'n' he w had a bit of a crack at Kostya for  uh not coming out in the last round . And then Tyson doesn't come out.

 Yes we got Jeff Fenech on Thursday night spoke to him today and he was quite buoyant and he says and I'll let him tell the story because  uh it's a great one. It's a very interesting story so  stay listening on Thursday  night  because we're gunna have Jeff Fenech and Mahatma Coat.

 Oh jeez that's a big night.

 So the big double.

 And what abh and there's a story theh bumping around uh over the weekend about Jeff threatening to perhaps uh take legal action against Danny Green. D'ya see  that . Train yeah suh  something along the lines of uh he may still technically be his manager and uh he uh proceeds may need to be coming to him still that uh huh he hasn't received or something 'n'  then he says he might train Mundine as well.

 Not a chance in the world anyway we will um we'll try and uh let you know but uh let me tell you this he will not be training Anthony Mundine.

 What about a legal stoush with D Green.

 Mm I dunno Paul asked Jeff on  we'll know  with Jeff on well listen on Thursday night 'n'.

  Alright well whe what about  Tyson's fight mate what'd you think about that.

 I didn't see the fight I was in the I was at the footy match in Sydney. 

 I was texting  you every  every round.

 Yeah you texted me after the after I'd had the result from fifteen different people.

 Oh sorry I was the  only one who told you it was a T K O in the at the end of the sixth 'n'  it didn't come out 'n'.

 Daniel had already informed me as a matter of fact what happened.

 He doesn't know about boxing.

 To Wanneroo hello Wayne.

 G'day Brad how are you.

 Good mate.

 Mate I'm I'm ringing up about is um I'm the footy manager at Wanneroo Kingsway Footy Club.

 Yep.

 Oh good is he playing uh which team is he playing for do you know.

 Uh  he's playing for the All Stars.

 Ah good he's on our side that'll be great.

 Yeah .

 Well I'll uh I'll say g'day to the young man and uh wish him well we'll look out for him mate.

 Yeah I I believe he's the well I would think he'd be the first bloke from uh community footy in W A  isn't he  who's certainly played in that game so.

 Yeah well ih when they ran that national wide uh Wayne to  try 'n' y'know you just should uh to click on the W W W dot Ray White I think it was uh and uh suggest why you should be playing.

 Hey Wayne just have a word.

 They might play him on they might play him on Libba.

 Well matey he warmed up on Sunday with seven goals so.

 Yeah  did he.

 Yeah.

 Well mate t t tell him what to do if he wants to be famous and uh y'know a hero in Western Australia tell him to either run through Libba or Dermot alright  one of those two just ping one of those and uh we'll we'll uh y'know he when he comes back we'll all be at the airport to uh cheer him on.

 Yeah I tell you what if they get in his way he'll run through 'em  .

 Will he . Ah beautiful .

 Good on you how old is he uh Wayne.

 He's nineteen.

 Nineteen good on him well  I'll look well I'll say g'day to the young man tomorrow  Ben Ben Cuming.

 You never muh  you never move Barney from beside the goal post.

 Nah we I'll see him in the change rooms  before we go . That's what I'm saying  before we go  good on you Wayne and thanks for letting us know so whe where where was he from Wanneroo was it.

 Yeah Wanneroo.

 Wanneroo. Up there at uh whatta they call.

 Kings Kingway  was a huge huge area.

 To Ferndale hello Andy.

 Oh hi Brad. Er good luck uh good luck tomorrow night.

 I I'm gunna need it.

 H hope you get a kick .

 Yeah. I hope I get on.

 Hope you  get a respirator.

 No you'll get on. Yeah wuh one of those famous runs down the wing.

 Who's  coaching who's coaching you Barney.

 Uh Graham Cornes he takes it a bit serious . S needs a good short sharpy  under the chin to.

 He's a strange fella.

 And a beat a ih  the only thing is if you knock Cornesy out Andy.

 Yeah.

 Knuckles Kerley takes over and he's worse .

 What's the go with all the South Australians . S need Mal isn't Mal Brown around.

 He's still bluing from all those years ago when Victoria used to wallop him. I'm sure of it. So and what would you wanna say Andy anyway.

 Uh yeah I just wanted to wish you bit of luck I'd and I'd and the Dockers'll murder those mongrels on suh Sunday.

 The Roos.

 Yeah the Roos  yeah and uh the um the umpires when it trickled  little bit of rain the other night  done a great job at the Eagles game  . The mongrels won .

 Good on you Andy  stay listening mate you might be in the crowd on the weekend.

 What about them wearing the red uniforms too. Is it it was reddish 'n' they wuh uh th they were playing the bombers I mean  fair dinkum y'know yeah v apparently every Monday morning the first item on the heavy hitters' meeting at the A F L house or whatever it's called is what colour should the umpires' uniforms be this week depending on the games . I mean it's big stuff innit y'know. What colour should we have this week oh  orange or yellow.

 Well I think they should be  a little bit different to whatever the colours are of the teams that are out on the ground I think that'd help I mean 'cos  sometimes there is a clash. To Willetton hello Val.

 Yeah how youse going.

 We missed you last night what happened to you we tried you about three times I reckon.

  Sorry I've  bumped a a a.

 The phone outta the wall.

 Yeah okay  um I'd just like to talk about  um the Dockers.

 Mm.

 And um Johnson.

 Michael Johnson.

 He was on Hall.

 He was.

 And he did an absolutely fantastic job 'n' I haven't heard much about it on the radio.

 Well we did on Sunday we we gave him a bit of rap we said that the boy was a little unlucky on a couple of occasions and Barry kicked uh a few goals on him but  there were a couple of times there he was caught outta position not not following any s yih too far but it was just enough to 'cos Barry was a little bit more seasoned a little bit more experienced 'n' judged the flight better.

 Well more mature isn't it  I mean that age man uh um compared to Michael I think is outstanding  with Michael.

 'N' y'know what Val  he is gunna learn so much from that. I was talking to Sheeds during the week 'n' he was saying that remember when uh Gary Ablett kicked fourteen goals one day.

 Mhm.

 Mm.

 Guess who played on him for most of the day .

 James Hird.

 James Hird and  uh y'know they you just learn so much from that just watching  'em but. 'N' he'll be a g he'll be a better player for it 'n' he'll be a good player for the club no doubt about it.

 Oh I know and the other thing is  that the good players in the Dockers  everybody's bag m most people are bagging them but when um any of the top players get the ball there's three four or five opposition players around the crumbs  'n' the same with Jeff Farmer and um  Brisbane Brisbane coach said that um all they had to do was contain Jeff  and  he had about five players on him all the time and there was no way he could get the ball and kick a goal.

 Yeah I dunno about  I dunno about Jeff Val as much as Pavlich definitely got double teamed 'n' 'triple teamed 'n'. Got an email here from Frank uh down in Fremantle Barney and uh he saw Kevin Sheedy today with his wife  down at on the cafe strip or the cappuccino strip ih at Gino's is it Gino's. Gino's  isn't it  yeah having a  coffee down there no sight of uh anyone else that he was meeting or anything like that if you wanna start any rumours but uh   there's no no he's just having enjoying uh Western Australia Sheeds obviously loves it over here.

 Good on him. Good stuff to Yangebup hello Rob.

 Uh yeah how you going Brad 'n' Barra.

 We're good.

 Hey uh  I'm a uh Dockers member  uh fortunately me mate bought me a uh membership and uh I've been to the going to the games like um start of the year . But uh I won't be going to the football next uh week because um unless they pull their ringholes out and uh get their act together  um I don't wanna watch 'em 'cos they're that frustrating   and um I was just wondering who's the recruitment um team down there like they just seem to recruit a lot of um WAFL players. 'N' I know the Eagles recruit WAFL players as well but they seem to get a few good players from over east d'y'know what I mean . And um also I was just wondering how uh me mate D Oliver's going Brad if you've uh spoken to him lately.

 Yeah no he was uh ma I spoh I did speak to him about uh ten days ago no he was uh going along nicely and he's enjoying a fair bit of the footy at the moment they're in a good year for him to be following the West Coast too Rob to be quite honest because they keep notching up wins no he he is going well but uh as we say he's got a bit of a decision to make at a little bit further down the track whether he tries to ride with the rods in his back that he's got there at the moment titanium rods or he has an operation to take them out so I've got a funny feeling that he might like to um take them out 'n' spend the extra time on the sidelines 'n' come back 'n' make sure he's a million per cent but good on you Rob I'm sure he um enjoys and yours and everybody else who listens to eight-eighty-two six P R's interest in him. Nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two is our open line number Adrian Anderson'll be ready after the break here on Sports Today.



 Sports Today with Brad 'n' Barra for Panasonic Ducted Air Conditioning and Craft Decor g'day guys to buh both establishments great sponsors of Sports Today to Ferndale g'day Pete.

 How you going Brad how you going Barra.

 Good mate .

 Uh just to um that guy who was saying he's never gunna go and watch the Hickory Dickories again . Come on mate show some loyalty eh  you wanna be a Magpie you gotta  stay with 'em y'know.

 Yeah I know  I agree with yih you 'n' agre.

 It's like saying  Barich leave Perth . Y'know what I mean.

 Yeah . No we  agree with you Pete 'n' I think we've always maintained we've been uh we've been critiques of er of Fremantle there's no doubt about that but uh I've always maintained have we not Barra that y'know if you expect the boys to fight on the field you should be f ready to fight on the terraces as  slang that is to support them that's all.

 Where do you stand with uh leaving early.

 Oh they can do what they like I don't mind  it's up to people's ch it's peetshuh that's a person's choice if they choose to leave because they're not happy with what they're seeing that's fine 'n' if they wanna stay till the end well that's fine too.

 Do you think it's a good statement to make though to stay to the bitter end and.

 It's not a statement. I mean ih rea I mean.

 You don't think it's a statement .

 No I don't  oh unfortunately  not I mean  people read too much into their own actions . To be quite honest. I mean do you reckon the players look  over the fence and say naw people are leaving.

 But it is pretty embarrassing when you the the stah stadium empties out at three quarter time when you y'know when you're playing 'n' you look 'n' you see people streaming out 'n' you think phew yeah.

 But it's it's it's not high on their priority list Barra that's what I'm saying I mean I'm not saying it's y'know that the people y'know er if they feel as though it's a statement well they they probably think they are but there there are probably better ways to go about it I would suggest but anyway weh that's that's their choice as we say 'n' ih people pay their money they're entitled to leave 'n' go 'n' come when they want to. To Gosnells hello Karen.

 Oh yeah hi guys yeah that's the trouble isn't it too much money um no I'd suggest to that guy that yeah he's not a very good supporter because when the chips are down and things aren't going too well and the Eagles are doing so well um yeah it's all very well for some people to say oh I'm not gunna go along and support but that's when we really do need the suppor  supporters to come along  and just a typical example was that last week my son um went into a service station and all the there was a big promotional thing about Eagles obviously and him being a real fanatical supporter um when he saw that they were all wearing Eagles T-shirts and all this kind of thing he said what's going on um and he they just said y'know oh yeah Eagles blah blah blah and he said well can't you see I'm a Dockers supporter and showed the keyring and his car with all the stickers and because it was like pay before you go it was late at night  he just walked out of the store and went somewhere else  . So y'know there's different ways of supporting your club  and um y'know show your colours guys and uh .

 Karen   we've gotta get a that bit of that tribalism back in 'em Karen that's what we've gotta do.

 Yeah it's all  territorial isn't it.

 Yes it is.

 What about leaving what about leaving early though there's this debate whether ih if ye if you wanna make a statement uh yih yih ih 'n' say to the club look we're not happy or the players or whoever the coach whatever  leaving early's the way to do it what do you think.

 No I don't think I would never leave early 'cos you pay good money to go there  and not only that like I said ih wuh y'know if the score's y'know one point to twenty goals well that that's when your team needs you the most because like I said no-one likes getting beaten 'n' especially thrashed by lots  but I dunno it's just y'know if you're a fan you're a fan 'n' it luh y'know like I said when when you do win it becomes all the more sweet eh ih if you don't win so much  and y'know people winning all the time well y'know good luck to the Eagles they're  doing well  but y'know it'll be sweet when we do win.

 Oh I agree Karen 'n' I I I just think I just keep urging the Fremantle supporters to keep going along I I think Barry you'd get a better t a worse taste in your mouth if you were a player. You would probably recognise it when you come out first on the ground 'n' if there was no people in the stands then then you might be thinking  hello what's  going on here. But uh  for 'em to leave  midway through a game uh uh or y'know third quarter or whatever I think that's everybody's prerogative.

 The worst taste in the in my mouth I got was uh when I got spat on at the M C G   who wants to go over there.

 Who was it.

 Uh oh yeah good on you no  it was the fans mate 'n' they those Collingwood fans they just 'n' I wasn't .

 Tell tell your family to stay at home Barra when  you're playing will you.

 Yeah um exactly leave me alone.

 Adrian Anderson joins us and he sees a fair bit of the uh grassroots footy 'cos he's still playing himself he's the A F L general manager of football operations hello Ade.

 How you going Brad Barra.

 Mm things are alright whadda your wuh wuh what's your stance on people whether they wanna leave at midway through the third quarter if they're not happy with their side.

 Oh look y'know I think it's better to stay there to the end but sometimes y'know like if uh I I remember going out to Waverley Park as a kid with the old man 'n' if you got caught in the uh traffic after  the final siren it was about three and a half hours to get out . So uh if it looked like uh it was wuh one-way traffic uh often uh we'd get dragged back out into the car park kicking and screaming at about three quarter time 'n' in retrospect I can understand why.

 Nice 'n' cold out there . You would've been there in uh were you there in nineteen-ninety-one preliminary final.

 Yes.

 E Eagles V Geelong  and the coldest day in the history of the world   wasn't it .

 It gets cold out there it used  to be about ten degrees colder than anywhere else in Victoria I think.

 But it's supposedly it's in the rain belt isn't it Adrian  don't they say or something.

 That's right.

 Yeah it was  a brilliant idea to build at Collingwood.

 Mind you I c I was over in Perth on the weekend 'n' I tell you what I was uh  driving along down uh Caves Road ih ih uh at at on um  bay.

 Oh just down just down Margaret River were you.

 Yeah it was about twelve o'clock and uh looked at the temperature there it was huh it was sleeting it was five-point-five degrees 'n' I thought take me back to Melbourne.

 Just   checking on grassroots footy were you or.

 No we uh  came uhl across for the game on the Friday night.

 Yes.

 And um and then uh huh had a chance to uh to slip down south there for a for a day or so with the uh with the girlfriend but uh  I tell you what the weather wasn't .

 Is this getting serious.

 It yeah geh getting reasonably serious.

 Ooh  righto  no announcements yet.

 Watch this space. Watch this space. Mate what about the split weekend coming up uh um fixturing uh uh I know we know that Melbourne are probably gunna jump up and down a bit this week with the uh the short break Monday to Saturday.

 Yeah look uh I I spoke to Ben today about that apparently when the uh fixturing's done the Melbourne uh requested uh to play on the Monday the Queen's Birthday Monday and then the with the turnaround uh on the Sunday uh well I think there was a difficulty playing them with a wuh on the on the Sunday in Melbourne giving the Eagles chance to get back uh on flights or something so uh that was buh my understanding of how that ih situation eventuated.

 So  no chance like Melbourne's asking it to be moved to Sunday or has asked it be moved onto Sunday there's no chance of that then is there.

 Look uh not that I'm aware of but again it's really up to y'know Ben Buckley 'n' the uh y'know  the the the fixturing guys to uh to to to uh to deal with any request  like that but not that I'm aware of.

 Yeah I'm sure Ben obviously knows about this 'cos he's obviously studied it uh but in the N R L as in you might know this too what they do is they have a six week program  and uh every six weeks they revise it 'n' depending on who's playing well 'n' who's not as to who plays in the big games on a Friday night y'know so someone's like ya y'know say Richmond was right down the bottom 'n' you wouldn't want 'em on a Friday night or s or or uh Hawthorn or whatever you'd put someone else in there 'n' then they rejag they rejig it. Is it does that got merit d'ya think.

 Um I think there's some real negatives in doing that um one of them is that yih wuh by releasing our fixture early y'know people plan their uh years around uh who's playing when and where y'know they might pick pick uh y'know a game where uh y'know the Eagles or Dockers are travelling to either Sydney or Brisbane or  uh Melbourne on any given particular weekend 'n' it gives people the opportunity to plan their uh years around uh um when the games are on and uh if you if you start doing it on a sort of a six weekly type basis you you take away that sort of certainty out of it.

 Okay 'cos uh I guess the networks'd love it there's no doubt about that. Now I saw you oh you said you were over in the west you were obviously at the Eagles game Friday night um uh at one stah I was at the back there standing behind you at one stage there I saw a a television reporter turn to you and say those umpires . How do you firstly how do you find that and secondly  what about the umpires . Who knows.

 Oh dear look I I I y'know I think in the uh in the wash up it was probably a pretty even performance by the umpires and I don't think uh y'know either side I think um I'd uh just after he'd finished telling me what  a hard go the Eagles were getting I'd a Essendon supporter telling me what a hard go they were getting  but  no I reckon it's a no-win situation but y'know overall I thought they were pretty good y'know they let the uh the the play go a bit uh in the wet conditions made them um and we saw some really hard desperate footy it was uh it was good to see 'n' I reckon it's fantastic uh y'know f um to see thirty-eight and a half thousand people in those sorta conditions come out 'n' see ih y'know the players real slog it out in those uh conditions was fantastic it was great to be there.

 Speaking of umpires uh offering fines now to players who collide with uh umpires accidentally or intently 'n' 'n' why wouldn't it of Michael Voss one of our great nates  uh have b have been charged for pushing Kouta into the umpire.

 Yeah I think hum from  what I can gather .

 But someone's fired sorry just before I suh just  to add to that wuh uh but what ih what what has happened don't do it again someone says now. I mean.

 Yeah look   I I think today um one of the players in um said I don't think Voss actually himself made contact with the umpire.

 No he pushed  Kouta there.

 But ih if you negligently make contact with an umpire you get fined for that 'n' that's been the case for uh b uh y'know I think a couple of years now but if you recklessly or intentionally make contact with an umpire you're looking at uh a a suspension and if it's intentional y'know probably a lengthy suspension 'n' we s remember Greg Williams's uh suspension was uh y'know for pushing an a uh uh an umpire uh years ago was certainly at the hefty end of the uh scale . Um when you push someone else into an umpire that could amount to something like misconduct 'n' I think uh uh y'know maybe uh Michael got the uh benefit of the doubt there but uh I think the match review panel have made it clear er that um um warning players against that sort of conduct 'n'  I think that's probably um.

 Wuh a a and look it's becoming apparent too Adrian 'n' I I know you see a lot of football 'n' you're a keen student of it  uh players are using umpires as screens.

 Yeah look and ih huh um.

 That's never happened before.

 Yeah look uh I think when this problem arose a couple of years ago y'know players were uh er were taking a few uh too many liberties in terms of uh positioning themselves behind umpires 'n' um y'know the a clear message was sent that they need to take the responsibility to avoid contact with the umpires 'n' uh I think that um y'know that uh the match review panel's uh uh sent that message uh uh reasonably clearly uh this weekend as well.

 Couple of other uh g off-air callers that wanted some g ask you some questions one was uh  uh if you take a mark 'n' you go back to take a kick 'n' then you play on 'n' you get tackled uh ih would that be considered prior opportunity.

 Uh usually that would be oh I think that would be considered prior opportunity but um y'know if there's a split second between uh running off your mark 'n' getting tackled that may not necessarily be y'know prior opportunity or reasonable time but ih if there's any sort of reasonable time in between running o playing on and getting tackled you would expect that uh uh uh a free kick would be payed if it was an incorrect disposal.

 So just to explain that uh so if somebody gets the ball 'n' they play on and they've had cha a chance to unload it with by either hand or foot and then they get sort of half tackled but they still get a kick away that's holding the ball isn't it.

 No if you get a kick away if you get a correct disposal away uh th th that's not um uh I mean it's hard to generalise but ih ih in in majority of situations if you get a clean disposal by hand o a handball or a kick away you won't be penalised for holding the ball.

 Alright that's uh that clears that up because a few people worried about that 'n'  and and Brad's been on about y'know s people sweating on ball winners 'n' that d d gih ih prior opportunity encourages people to do that it's a tagger's paradise.

 Uh look oh uh I don't think so I think that um uh what we saw last year t p uh was the highest uh rate of secondary bounces ever um when we're talking last year about the game as a spectacle one of the key issues was uh the number of stoppages  and people deliberately holding the ball in and forcing stoppages and absorbing tackles when they had a reasonable opportunity to get rid of the ball  um this year  the umpires have upped the ante a little bit on players when they do have an opportunity to get rid of the ball and the other aspect of the holding the ball rule that a lotta people don't understand I think ih is that and maybe we should communicate better is that even if you haven't had a prior opportunity and you're tackled you still have to make an attempt to get rid of the ball if your arms are free. So if you sit there with your arms free having been tackled and do nothing that is holding the ball under  the uh under the laws of Australian football  you must make an effort.

 And just one more here Barney sorry uh Cameron Mooney deliberate out of bounds in the Geelong game uh Geelong Adelaide have you id had a chance to look at it and uh what was your view.

 Yeah I I saw that one uh today um and I asked a uh the the the um I think it was one that they uh found a difficult one to uh adjudicate on because when they look at deliberate you look at they look at a couple of things 'n' and wuh w well for the first question is wuh what's the player's intent well um to work that out they look to y'know ih how much pressure was the player under and uh secondly y'know was there a uh uh how with what sort of force did the ball go over the boundary line and was there a team mate in the vicinity so in this case they said well he was under a lotta pressure he's being tackled  um th uh the team mate uh Ling was in the vicinity but he wasn't right up close to where it was 'n' what sort of force did it go over with did he handball it straight out on the full no it bounced twice before it went over so weighing those things up they thought y'know was a was a was a a line ball one 'n' they um y'know that's about it I guess.

 Good on you Adrian thanks very much for your time hope you got some nice wine when you were down south.

 Thanks for having me on guys.

 Adrian Anderson there from the A F L after seven Paul Barnard's gunna join us he's playing in the E G gah E J game tomorrow night but I wanna talk to him about something else Barra  here on Sports Today.

"
" We are Talking Real Estate on eight-eighty-two Six P R thank you Len and good morning to Craig Turnbull from Aspire how are you mate.

 Good morning Harvey and good morning Perth the answer is fantastic.

 Fantastic that's very very good indeed nice uh day it'll be a bit later on to uh go out 'n' have a look at um well first of all the uh Eagles probably whacking the Hawks unfortunately  but also to go 'n' have a look at real estate today.

 Yeah great day to be uh in real estate ab absolutely I think the sun'll be out and uh not too hot and uh good time to be out there uh there's not that much on the market right now Harvey uh only about seven-thousand statistih statistically speaking and that's quite a lot less than than what's normally uh the case normally luh in a inverted commas average market there's about twelve-thousand 'n' what it means is there's a lot of competition for uh the good property out there. Uh lotta my mentoring students 'n' people that I that we deal with are saying Craig w y'know wuh we're putting our offers in 'n' 'n' getting beaten because uh the market's still very strong out there.

 Yeah it is. There's no doubt about that still going s going gang busters really isn't it. And uh no sign of slowing it doesn't seem.

 No uh it hasn't I look it hasn't been a crazy market Harvey but it's been steadily strong 'n' that's actually that that's quite good. I think uh overall um the rest of Australia is complaining that um real estate market's gone quiet but it's not the case over here. There's lot of indicators which uh show us it'll keep continuing Harvey I think all going well all things being equal that is. Uh and one of those is uh on the paper today Harvey. It's on page eleven  Perth house rents jump fourteen per cent  this year. That's quite incredible uh what they're saying is the median house rent now for a home is two-hundred-and-seventeen-dollars a week and um units d rose sixteen per cent to a hundred-and-fifty-nine. There's a lot going on um lot of high quality homes being built which is lifting the median price and also um there is been a sharp rise in rental uh sorta take up rates um vacancy rate's fallen Harvey from two years ago where it was four per cent down to two-point-six per cent now what that means is there's there's less homes available for renters to take up . And as there's less 'n' less available prices start to move up . Now at three per cent uh that's like the market balance. Uh and anything under that means r rents will continue to move up so as long as the vacancy rate's tight like that rents'll go up and uh people who are renting uh look I'm sorry folks the rents will keep moving up.

 I was gunna say people who're gunna read this that have got investment properties are gunna say hang on I haven't put the rent up for a couple of years I'm gunna do so now.

 That that's correct  that's quite correct lotta s prop lotta property managers out there will be going oh gee I haven't lifted thah lifted our rents lately  and in the next reviews they'll all be going up now what else this does is that uh it means investors are gunna look at this and go oh we can get a better rent return . Because the last couple years uh prices have moved up quite a bit but rents haven't followed. And it means that the rent returns f on the investment have been l have been low or getting getting smaller.

 Yes people that have been uh for example buying uh let's say a two-hundred-thousand dollar investment property uh you should be getting y'know f this is what we've learned over the years uh two-hundred dollars a week rent but they've been getting around about say the one-eighty one-eighty-five mark now.

 Or or even less.

 Yeah and now they're gunna go like two-ten two-fifteen  that's how I read that.

 It's completely possible  um the the Perth rents have traditionally been a little bit low. I think uh compared the rest of the country but it ih it is catching up  so um for those of you out there sitting thinking that maybe that you'll wait around 'n' just keep renting and you wait for the price of property to come down I I can't see it not in the  in the immediate short term. Barring interest rate doubling tomorrow night  and I'm not saying that's gunna happen of course but uh the the market everything everything all the indicators for our market are quite strong Harvey.

 Mm. Alright uh give us a call nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two or real estate at six P R dot com dot A U real estate at six P R dot com dot A U you can call us now get in nice 'n' early as I've been exhorting you to do and um I'm surprised you've had time to pop in this morning you're a busy lad at the moment how's the s the seminar going.

 Great we started last night I've got a group of sixty very excited happy people all learning about real estate 'n' themselves 'n' how to invest 'n' plans 'n' strategies 'n' they're learning stuff they never thought that that that they would  and we've got two full days as soon as I finish here I'll be racing off down to the to the technology park function centre 'n' they'll be there waiting so that's g great. I only get to do it once a year  these days um there was a time early in uh my education career where we're doing it four or five times a year but these days we've got our mentoring groups we've got our finance broking we've got our prop property find our project marketing and we're looking at some land investments there's there's so much happening for us right now Harv I just don't get to do this any more than once a year.

 Yeah alright and uh you go today and tomorrow as well.

 Today and tomorrow  two 'n' a half full days which is great so very excited about it.

 Alright well I must pop into one of those one of these days so that I'll know what you're not ness I'm I haven't got any extra cash at the moment that is for sure but having said that just to see uh y'know what it's like.

 What we do  Harvey you'd always be welcome.

 Alright lovely. Okay uh Isaac of Merriwa you're welcome too to uh call us or you have. Good morning Isaac.

 Good morning how are you .

 Good morning Isaac fantastic.

 Oh that's good um I was just ringing up to find out what your opinion would be about the northern corridor sort of around  noh or north of Clarkson um Merriwa all those sort of areas. Um wuh within the next say three four years. I've got a house I've already bought um last year and I'll probably be selling it about say another three four years when I move.

 Okay so you're talking about Clarkson 'n' m and Merriwa.

 Uh Merriwa  yeah.

 Well look if you'd asked me ten years ago  about Clarkson or Merriwa I would have said well just try and avoid it because um when they first developed the area ten fifteen years ago there was they they they had inexpensive blocks and filled up by inexpensive homes and the developers at the time didn't put any y'know limestone walls in to level the blocks up some of them are like sides of mountains  and um they were all cut and filled and uh it didn't look attractive and the homes weren't the best available 'n' I would've said well y'know try 'n' steer clear but  um these days uh l like the the latter part of the developments have been really good  and pricewise very inexpensive compared  with what's around it like Clarkson the median price is only two-hundred-and-ten-thousand currently  a and uh Merriwa uh it's not much more than that I think it's actually yeah actually bang on two-ten as well so  what's happening is you've got Mindarie's been revitalised  and there's new shopping centres gone in there you've got the freeway being extended 'n' the railway line's on its way up there . So those two things the freeway and the railway will make a massive difference  to Merriwa and Clarkson and at two-ten-thousand it's now looking pretty cheap actually  . So I think you'll find if you if you look at I mean there's there's areas within areas there's suh  some parts of Clarkson Merriwa Merriwa which are looking really good so that'd be a fantastic spot to hang onto  particularly with the railway and freeway o unuh on the way.

 Yeah you don't know how far the freeway's going up do you.

 Uh look I gotta look at my map here. It's on it's way up to I think it's cuh th Currambine now is the the railway that is. My understanding is they plan to push it right through well  way past that but uh  how when I don't know. Um  there there's talk that in future it'll end up at Yanchep but I mean I'd I don't know.

 Yeah but they're concentrating on the Kwinana freeway extension at the moment  obviously but yeah .

 They they can only do one thing at a time.

 The railway goes all the way to Clarkson now the station's already open.

 Okay good that well  that that's good news  and but the but the freeway's coming.

 Yeah that's right yeah alright thanks for that.

 Yeah so look I mean hang on and uh I think thah y'know it's inexpensive real estate compared to what's around it.

 Good  on you thanks Isaac uh good little pocket up there by the way is a little suburb now called Ridgewood. I know a bit about this 'cos I well I had two kids living there at one stage I've still got one living there. And uh Ridgewood was uh part of Merriwa. It was uh the old Carnegie Heights estah I think it was Carnegie Heights or ss cuh Carnegie something anyway estate and uh Ridgewood is is quite a nice little sorta suburb within a suburb if if you like 'n'  uh mm.

 Well look at the difference Harv ih with with um Merriwa Clarkson the your median price is at two-ten . Now in Ridgewood which is right in the middle it's two-forty-seven  and a half. Quite  quite a bih quite a big difference  because that was like one of the later stages  so to speak and they learnt their lessons from first the first part of that developments and it's ih done at a much higher standard and the prices reflect that.

 Yeah. I was house-sitting up there uh for my daughter 'n' son-in-law when they went up to Singapore for a little holiday and uh it's funny because  it was only for a few days but you get kinda used to having a a good look at the suburb again . And I thought this is a l nice little jewel in the crown of uh those those suburbs at the moment.

 Yeah very much the same as um there's a suburb uh in the middle of Currambine I guess it's not really a suburb like an estate in the middle of Currambine called Somerly  and that's been put together very much like um Subi Centro in East Perth . And uh that's actually looking quite quite good as well. It's still a part of um tt uh sorta Currambine and Clarkson but uh it's it's called they've given a name 'n' they've given it an identity and uh prices there are quite a bit higher than what's around it.

 Yep okay nice little place to have a look at alright let's go to Como hello Joan.

 Oh good morning Harvey good morning Craig.

 Good morning Joan.

 It's gunna be a lovely day I hope.

 Absolutely.

  Yeah it looks lovely out there um I was just wondering what suburbs like you were saying Somerly but what prices did you say they're about two-forty-seven per um apartment are they.

 Nuh uh well they're  yeah there is there is an apartment complex going up in Currambine  prih prices starting at two-hundred-thousand 'n' that's that's right next to the railway there . We we said Ridgewood was two-forty-seven and a half as the median price that's the middle price.

 Yes.

 So half the sales were less than that 'n' half the sales were more than that just the middle price . 'Cos median price is a good guide.

 Oh right the medium price  and that is in um the suburb is again.

 That was Ridgewood.

 Ridgewood that's  right yes. 'Cos they're all sorta new I haven't always heard some of these before y'know I don't travel a huge amount  but with um the rental 'n' that it makes it a little bit hard 'n' if they're students the young people um they trying to find accommodation because they don't they c it's not always convenient to sort of young people that come from the country or wherever uh or s perhaps they're from other countries they don't always have a chance to um get accommodation every um kind of as students there is always a kind of overflow if you know what of young people trying to get accommodation.

 That's true and it's a bit of a challenge even more in the coming uh uh market Joan because vanc vacancy rate's very tight  and uh yeah it means rents are going up for it's evuh even more challenging for them.

 Yes that's right but I'm interested in reading that book of yours that you've got three books haven't you.

 I have yes.

 Yes okay.

 Have you got them.

 I'm sorry.

 Do you have the books or.

 Um no I was going to ha um try 'n' get the first one I  thought.

 Joan wuh there's three books the first one or the the beginning one so to speak is called It's Easy to Invest in Property.

 Easy to invest .

 It's Easy toh yeah that's that's for if you have got not a lot of knowledge about property that's a good one to start at that's a twenty dollar book . And then the next one's called It's Easy to be a Property Millionaire . And then the more advanced one is called Unlimited Cashflow.

 Unlimited Cashflow .

 Yeah now you can get any of those books any of those books from uh Angus and Robertson or Dymocks or Collins  um  or if you wanna buy all three together you could ring our office on Monday morning 'n' get a special package price.

 Uh at the office okay.

 Yeah and that's uh.

 Are you under your name aren't you.

 Yeah uh Craig Turnbull yes.

 Yes.

 So you could  go hunt those books out from ol almost anywhere or give our office a call on Monday.

 Good on you thanks for your call Joan it's sixteen minutes past seven.



 Okay it's twenty-four minutes past seven plenty of calls on the board Craig so let's get to them. Mary of Two Rocks g'day Mary.

 Ah g hi how you guys  going this morning.

 Hi Mary thanks for waiting.

 Uh listen I'm just wondering um you're probably aware of what's happening up here with Capricorn the Harford Grove and Lindsays Beach . And then uh that's down like towards Yanchep and then there's The Reef the all those blocks are opening soon I'm just wondering uh a lot of the uh blocks down at the Yanchep end are those cottage blocks two-hundred-and-thirty square metres.

  Yes.

 And then that then they seem to go up to about four-hundred there's one for seven-hundred-and-four square metres 'n' then a couple of two-thousand. I don't know what's gunna happen with The Reef but I'm just wondering how do you think this will affect uh like we're in Two Rocks we're in the yachting village. Would that tend to put the values up or drop them a bit. When all that development happens.

 I would tend to think Mary that that would increase values 'n' I'll tell you why. Um people who are buying the smaller blocks um oh actuh all those those homes that'll be built there will probably be pretty high quality  and depending on the covenants that the the developers have put on the on the land um uh I would think that that you've gotta build a certain quality and certain size home so what that tends to to do is lift the overall quality uh of housing in the area so uh uh prices will follow so.

 Right ih.

 I l I I think Yanchep and Two Rocks really needs that kind of developmys  myself.

 Yes uh what do you think uh do you know anything about what's happening with The Reef that's that's right uh on the border on the uh farmlands at Two Rocks there.

 Mary I don't I I really don't.

 No.

 No I'm sorry.

 Alright then.

 Okay Mary thank you uh let's go to Abe of Rivervale hello Abe.

 How're ya good morning gentlemen um  just just a question about uh we're looking to buy a property for the family to live in ourselves and uh we're looking at the suburb of Lynwood. What uh what are we what would we be looking at in terms of paying for a home there a three by one or a three by two.

 Ih good question um the median price in Lynwood as at March was two-hundred-'n'-five-thousand we're waiting for the June figures out 'n' I suspect Lynwood would have jumped quite a bit. Um two-oh-five sounds very very very very very cheap and I I think that that's got some real up upside in it compared to like what's around it like Langford's one-eighty-two uh you got other areas um Parkwood around it um y'know higher again than that so I think Lynwood's looking pretty cheap right now. Other thing with Lynwood is um the Lynwood Arms is gunna be I think part of it gunna be taken down and uh brand new townhouses're gunna be built there um Abe Saffron's just got that underway 'n' those townhouses'll be in a b sorta three-hundred-thousand plus price bracket so I I think that um Lynwood is great value so you probably looking probably for an like an like an average home in a good condition in Lynwood probably two-twenty to two-fifty I'd say something in in that range.

 Right right  excellent.

 Yeah is that that work for you.

 Yeah wuh well we've looked at a couple 'n' we're there's one that's a like a more of a an older home nineteens-fifties that's in our price range roughly and but it's on a big block like a nine-hundred square metre block.

 Yes.

 And uh they're the price would I'm just trying to find out what whether these p whether they're inflating the price or if it's reasonable they're looking at about two-thirty two-hundred-'n'-thirty-thousand for the home it's a three by two. So it's an older.

 Is there much mah much work to do on the home Abe.

 Um just just uh the roof needs to be replaced probably 'cos it's asbestos . But it's a it's a solid brick uh brick home uh floor tiles are it's painted it's already painted floor tile uh the it's got dark wooden floorboards uh and and a big uh backyard with a  with a with a uh concrete pool cement pool in it.

 Eh but it's not it's not bad value just get that roof changed 'n' and you'll be set I think.

 Right excellent  okay thanks very much.

 You're welcome matey . Let's head off to Kenwick g'day Christine.

 Oh good morning uh  I'd uh I'd just like to know about the values in Kenwick I heard you speaking about the one on Anaconda Drive in in um Gosnells. My place is about the same sound sounded about the same anyway. But we have a granny flat instead of the workshop. So I I just wondered where we were in Kenwick.

 Okay well median price that's the middle price in Kenwick uh as of March was a hundred-'n'-seventy-six-thousand. The lowest price was a hundred-'n'-sixty-seven so there's obviously a lot of lotta homes being sold in that price bracket and the the high price is five-hundred-'n'-fifty. Lotta activity out in Kenwick uh at the moment um uh t to get anything decent uh is getting much much harder under two-hundred-thousand these days.

 Yeah we  we keep getting real estate people offering to sell .

 Of course yeah because th they're all chasing listings 'cos there isn't much available out there so um people putting their homes on the market right now are starting to get y'know pretty good prices. Where you'd be look I don't know without seeing your property but I'd certainly say two-hundred plus but how far more than that I just don't know without seeing it so get get three appraisals written appraisals 'n' see what they say.

 Yeah.

 And oh  the highest one isn't always the best Christine.

 Thanks Christine ah before the headlines Carl of Maylands g'day Carl.

 Yeah g'day Craig and Harvey how you going.

 Fantastic Carl.

 Uh just want to ask you Craig uh what you know about the Mangles Bay development down there at Rockingham.

 Carl absolutely nothing  . Where where is it.

 It's uh it's heading towards y'know that the bridge that goes across to Garden Island.

 Yes I know the bridge very well.

 If you go onto the um Rockingham Development Authority's uh website there's something on there about Mangles Bay 'n' they're putting forward proposals to build a marina there and possibly c uh canals I think.

 Sorry now I know where you're talking about yeah  look look I I have heard of it but they're facing some stiff opposition from the locals  uh environmentals um and so on but uh there's a big push behind that particular section and in time it it will happen I think it should happen given that they can take care of all the environmental side of things  um I think it would really help uh Rockingham uh go ahead so keep your eye on that  the way to make money outta that kind of uh development is to get in there beforehand it's a risk because it's not a given it may or may not happen  mm but there's a bit of a a y'know there's a strong push behind that one so I I suspect in time ih it'll go ahead but I mean I I don't know for sure.

 Okay I've actually got a townhouse down there at Palm Beach so you think it's worth holding onto.

 Oh yes . Absolutely yeah yeah hang on to that one.

 Great thank you for that.

 Cheers.

 Good on you Carl thank you for your call bye.

 Bye.



 Worth waiting for wasn't it twenty-four minutes to eight o'clock nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two or real estate at six P R dot com dot A U. We've got Riaz has sent us a an email which we'll get to in a minute but Tony of Darch has been waiting on forever on the phone g'day Tony.

 How's it going.

 Good.

 Hi Tony.

 Hi how's it going I was just wanting to ask you a question um have you heard of a estate in Stirling called civling guh Civic Gardens Estate.

 Uh that's just right next to the um the old council building yes.

  Yeah that one there what do you reckon about that that's that little bit of l that little pocket there.

 Well uh uh  I th yeah.

 Blocks are about three-hundred-and-eighty square metres.

 Yes.

 And you have to put the the garages at the back 'n' the actual y'know no garage at the front but thah garah like a Subi Centro style.

 Yes.

 With the little laneway at the back what do you  what what'd something be worth  what would the house be worth at the end of the day when it's all done . The blocks are about two-twenty to buy.

 Yes.

 'N' then you gotta put ih and you can't put single-storey you have to go up on three-hundred-'n'-eighty square metres.

 Yeah uh what then what you'll find is then that uh  your prices probably end up between four five-hundred-thousand something like that. Um and look that little pocket of land there is like it really  for all intents and purposes shouldn't be residential it's like it's been created out of out of nothing and uh to get land like that in the middle of Stirling uh is not an easy thing to do and you will find that um creating land like that is is kind of unique and that's why they're they can get the prices they want it's r y'know just back from the freeway you're not far from y'know Karrinyup shopping centre y'know ten minutes from the beach you've ten minutes from town I think locationwise it's it's pretty good and uh what they are creating there is a high quality subdivision that'll uh be uh wuh will attract uh big houses 'n' people wih with big wallets so I think that uh if it is built the way I think it's gunna be built it could be terrific pih piece of real estate.

 Thank you very much indeed Tony uh Riaz as I said wrote to us. .

 Look I don't know what the exact prices are uh in Settlers Hill but uh Baldivis the the median prices are just jumping like crazy which is quite incredible. Um y we're looking at around about three-hundred-'n'-twenty-five-thousand as a median price 'n' that's what I mean the blocks are probably one-thirty to one-sixty kind of in that range 'n' then you're spending that again on a home so y with three-hundred three-twenty-thousand for ol almost like a first home out there. Most of 'em are being built four by two quite big homes and and mm ih they're all relatively high quality. Uh but Baldivis for mine 'n' Settlers Hill it sort of  I don't know it seems like a long way from anywhere for me. For mine um not down near the water it's just off the freeway I guess it's only like like a half hour trip into town. But uh I'm I'm not quite sure why the the prices are suh are so high there it's just  it's beyond me actually.

 Okay uh Paul of Connolly g'day Paul.

 Yeah g'day guys how are youse.

 Hey  Paul.

 Um yeah we just got a um uh situation we had couple of investment properties and our place um in Heathridge and we've sold one of the investment properties and our place and moved to um Connolly uh we've still got our investment property in Scarborough I was just didn't know whether we'd be best off um selling that  'cos all the equity's sort of in in the um the unit we've got in Scarborough  selling that 'n' sort of putting the money back into our own place 'n' then buying another investment property . Which we can fully negative gear.

 Yeah good question um there's a lotta things to s consider there number one what tax will you pay if if and when you pa you sell Scarborough that's one thing to consider. Um at the moment if you've got a big loan on Connolly and no loan on the Scarborough property well that's all back to front. Ideally as you put it uh you all your debt you want against property you're renting out so it's all tax-deductible so that's ideal.

 Yeah just tha tha tha that's the situation we've got where you don't know  you're looking at paying about thirty-thousand capital gains tax if we sell the unit in Scarborough.

 Yeah so how much is that gunna hurt you versus what you'll save  if you sold Scarborough used that money to pay your own home in Connolly off and then used the equity in Connolly to go again  um it it's a matter of sitting down and working the numbers Paul and perhaps getting some some accounting advice.

 Yeah where can you go to get accuh accounting advice 'cos I mean I've I've tried to find people 'n' they always try and sell you either houses or a development they're doing or they um.

  Okay.

 Know what I mean it's like there's no one out there who actually does that sort there's not that I can find anyway.

 Yeah look there you're you're right there're very few but look these days to survive in business you've gotta have more than one uh arrow ih in your quiver 'n' that's what what um suh the added value services are all about. Um look any number of ways you c you could look at it but if you want to know who my accountant is y would you like to know that or.

 Yeah yeah.

 Yeah guy named Nigel Plowman and he operates  his company's called McKinley Plowman  and they're up at Joondalup and.

  actually.

 Oh is he.

 Yeah believe it or not.

 Go and talk to Nigel I mean.

 Oh well we ee sort of wih went and spoke to Nigel once before 'n' he sort of um put onto one of his uh um accountants that works for him sorta thing.

 Okay.

 But yeah no I'll I will do that then.

 Yeah look sm smart fella smart company and uh he could give you some suggestions but uh I mean sit down and work it out for yourself I mean you you sound like a smart fella to me work the numbers and theh see what wha the best bet.

 Yeah cool not a problem.

 Cheers.

 Thanks Paul.

 Thank you see ya.

 Okay Irene Mossie Park g'day Irene.

 Uh good a good morning.

 Hi Irene.

 Hello.

 Yes Irene what can we do for you.

 Okay um I live in Mosman Park but my daughter is looking to buy a property in Cannington and I have absolutely no idea how to work out the prices this ih this is a vacant lot of four-hundred-'n'-ninety-eight square metres um adjoining recreation reserve on river frontage and they want three-hundred-'n'-fifty-thousand . Um because there's no history there of the h of a house being there 'n' it being sold previously how do you tell whether three-hundred-'n'-fifty-thousand is a reasonable price.

 Yeah good question that's a really tough one my my first instinct is that's a lotta money . A five-hundred square metre block in Cannington a vacant block you'd probably buy like a an ordinary one for about one-fifty one-sixty maybe  a a a v a vacant block of that size  but if it's like at a premium location there aren't many blocks like it available down on the riverside there you may well get more. Three-fifty sounds like a lotta money to me.

 Yeah  that's what I that was my first instinct.

 Yeah the the only way to uh really compare is to find some some other riverside lots like  maybe over at Wilson or depends on wuh y'know somewhere nearby  um very challenging to price something where there's nuh no other comparables and pretty much what the developers have gone is well this is unique  I'm gunna price it up at whatever I like 'n' 'n' y'know whoever if they wanna live there they'll they'll pay for it . To me it sounds like a lotta money.

 Okay. Okay thank you.

 Thanks Irene.

 Bye.

 Okay Irene thank you very much indeed uh who's next might be Susie at Herne Hill g'day Susie.

 Hi.

 Good morning Susie.

 Hi um I've just been given some um information about some blocks at Jurien Bay. They're house blocks and there's no time to build on 'em. What would be um like if I was to buy one and sell it without building on it would that be worth it.

 It depends on whether you can make a profit on it or not.

 Yeah I mean that's what I mean uh what's the aerh y'know is that area like uh I mean it's miles away y'know.

 Yeah it is Jurien's certainly moving though. There is a a few land subdivisions opening up there in anticipation of the that inner coastal road opening up 'n' when that does that's gunna make it more uh attractive to Perth people. I mean  it's closer than than um than Busselton-Dunsborough and every bit as attractive if you like the beach 'n' have been fishing 'n' that. Um and prices are are a loh are a lot cheaper I guess but uh y'know look whether or not you'd make a profit immediately will depend on how much land's available and what the demand is Susie just be careful  do some research and don't jump in in too much of a hurry okay.

 Okay then.

 Good luck.

 Thank you  Susie.

 Bye.

 Bye seventeen to eight.



 Thirteen minutes to eight and uh plenty of calls on the board still Roger of Padbury g'day Rog.

 Yeah morning Harvey 'n' Craig.

 Good morning Roger.

 Um  I've got a suh scenario Craig um where  um I've been transferred down uh to a country area and uh I'm living in the house my house at the moment which I nearly own. And uh I've got a a residential uh another residential property which I owe very little on and a commercial property which is positively geared. Now I've just bought another property uh in the um in the country area which I have to live in so there's no tax deduction for me there um I'm just wondering y'know sorta where do I go from here I've got approximate borrowings of five-sixty and approximate values of eight-ninety-six.

 Okay so what you're asking me is there uh room for you to luh invest some more property or is or is that what you.

 Yeah yeah basically um yeah what sort of what what sort of uh area can I go into now where I can hopefully y'know get some sorta tax deduction 'cos I'm just gunna beh be paying uh too much tax probably on my rents 'n' that.

 Alright well first thing about paying paying tax is it's great because number one it means you're breathing 'n' number two it means you're making a profit  so don't be too worried about it and there are laws for anyone anyone can use them to lower their tax so um first thing is to sit down and figure out where you're at now figure out where you wanna be in ten years from now and then work backwards 'n' if then follow a plan. One thing I've been teaching uh everyone at the seminar um I'm doing this weekend is make a plan. Alright sounds like you got the beginning of like yeah you know you wanna y'know look after yourself in the future but create a strong plan Roger 'n' then start working forward from there. It's a matter of finding out what it is you want what's right for you you got a couple of residential properties you got one commercial one and yeah look clearly figure out uh what kinda property fits in your portfolio and then go and buy some. Um do some great research make a plan and um make a good purchase so nothing wrong with that get my books I mean mm  really inexpensive go into or call our office on one-three-hundred-one-three-two-nine-four-one or any good bookstore and that'll give you some idea where to aim so make a plan is the is the most important thing I I could say to you Roger and then be confident you can go ahead.

 Okay. Alright thanks Craig.

 Thanks  for calling.

 Okay to Carine Wayne hello Wayne.

 Yeah good morning gentlemen.

 Hi Wayne.

 Um just a query on what do you think about Carine I just look at the surrounding uh suburbs like Marmian and North Beach seem to be flying ahead um Karrinyup's being rezoned 'n' y'know making lots of money 'n' Carine seems to be like the sleepy little suburb in the middle that's sorta just plodding away plodding away. Um do you see it going up much in the future or s just plugging away as it has been for the last say fifteen years or so.

 Well Carine tt I dunno why it really has as you say just plugged along  um look at uh Gwelup on the other side of it  um that's really come along with all the new homes that were built there uh and I mean the the price at Gwelup is around three-hundred-'n'-forty-thousand as of March but it's three-seventy as December so Gwelup's nice. Carine's looking around about the four-hundred-thousand sort of median price uh as as of March but uh North Beach and Marmian are more than a hundred-thousand more than that. So Carine by comparison looks like pretty good value to me. I think uh uh y'know it's not bad buying there  um have you got property there already.

 Yeah I own a property here I've h had it here for about seventeen years but  um y'know it's that it's the wh whether you sell or not 'n' move on y'know if you sell it it's gunna go isn't it  if you don't ih it won't sort of thing.

 Yeah look the last five years uh Carine's improved by nine-point-six per cent per year so  if you look at that versus all the areas around it it really has underperformed uh I don't know why . Um I don't think that'll stay that way forever myself.

 No.

 Uh I I think Carine's got all the all the I wants it's close to everything you wanna be close to and I think that uh you'll probably see in the next three to five years a lot of uh extended building going on there. Now what I mean by that is renovations happening 'n' people adding uh adding rooms to the large blocks that are there . And yeah you'll find that the suburb will start improving so y'know look if unless you can find uh another area that you think'll perform better why would you sell why would you sell 'n' pay any tax 'n' pay all those transfer fees 'n' if you're happy there stick around.

 Yeah that's right okay then thanks for that mate.

 Thanks.

 Good on you thank you bye.

 See you later Wayne hello Betty of Mullaloo.

 Hello Craig and Harvey.

 Hi  Betty.

 I've just would like your opinion please I've been looking around for three by two by twos. I have sold my home 'n' so I have about three-hundred-'n'-twenty-thousand to spend on an on a three by two by two  I've looked in Innaloo um uh Nollamara Morley all those areas around there and I've been stuck on the best designer and the best unit I can see is in Nollamara South Nollamara  where they're doing lots of new units and new two-storey homes. Is it a good idea I'm going to be putting in an offer in today perhaps to hold the unit for myself. It's not quite finished until October but the builders and the uh owners want between three-twenty-five 'n' three-thirty-five for the it's a duplex arrangement a three by two by two  a lovely design.

 Is it single-storey Betty.

 Yeah single-storey.

 Alright and uh a large home.

 Yes lounge room and family room in this yi it's a duplex but it's got a lounge room and a family room and love lots of cupboards and a lovely design.

 Alright now the median price in Nollamara as at March was two-fifty-three uh with a bullet that's really jumping up there  I think there's still room to go. Uh if you look at uh 'n' like Yokine it's three-fifty median price.

 I can't find  anything that's nice around  three-twenty.

 See Yokine's nearly a hundred-thousand more and  you're talking about inverted commas South Nollamara I guess that's the that's that's the better part of Nollamara if if you could say that  and that's on the Yokine border so uh by comparison that looks like reasonable value. Um so look I I can't see any any challenge why you shouldn't make that offer if it's within your budget how how how much have you looked around Betty.

 I have been searching I've been going through these concrete slabs on the ground and   half-walls and asking for them to send me the plans and seeing there's no cupboards and there's y'know things are wrong with all the units.

 Alright but this one's singing to you.

 This one's lovely .

 Theh then this is the one that that's for you  I think.

 Thank you cr uh  Craig I was  hoping  you would say that.

 Betty it sounds okay.

 Good on you.

 Thank you bye-bye.

 It's seven minutes to eight uh good morning now.



 Running outta time Craig four minutes to eight o'clock time though to talk to Laurie at Cooloongup g'day Laurie.

 Yeah good morning.

 Morning Laurie.

 Juh uh wanna get a bit of an idea of what the property around um Cooloongup or East Waikiki or something like that they call it  uh four by one double garage plenty of parking rumpus room all that just get a bit of an idea.

 Okay very hard for me to give you an exact number without seeing your home um  I can tell you that the the Cooloongup median price that's the middle range price which you'd think'd be like a three by one uh was a hundred-'n'-eighty-thousand as at uh the end of March and in uh Waikiki it was two-hundred-'n'-fifteen-thousand now that's uh you'd think that'd be a three by one so if it's a four by one and it's a great place and it's in good condition Laurie you'd certainly be over two-hundred-thousand but how much I don't know. Um have you had uh any local real estate agents give you an appraisal yet.

 Ah y get plenty of informuh plenty of pamphlets in the letterbox.

 Yeah stacks of 'em . Look it wouldn't hurt to invite one or two of the the I guess the more well-known ones to come 'n' give you a written appraisal. Are you actually thinking of selling or just trying to figure out what it's worth.

 Ah just get a bit of an idea I'm at a bit of a dilemma at the moment um uh so I just have to uh hang fire  but  there's no harm in getting some info.

 Yeah looh I I'm guessing and I really I'm not sure without y'know get a local specialist in there but uh but probably at least two-hundred maybe two-twenty-thousand somewhere in that range but uh g get some local help Laurie uh 'n' that that's your best bet.

 Thanks Laurie quickly Gail uh just uh purchased a second investment home six months old unfinished. They've borrowed the full amount plus enough to add a patio. .

  That's a good question there's so many m mixes 'n' matches with that one.

 Well why don't I print this out and uh you can have a look at it during the week 'cos it is an all day question isn't it.

 Yeah it it uh f I need to understand what happened there I don't know whether they're living in it or not living in it um ih if you're living in it doesn't make any difference because you can't claim any depreciation benefits. Um look print that one out Harv 'n'  'n' I'll take that one under advisement.

 Okay now just before we go wanted to talk to you about an article wuh was it Wednesday's paper about  big redevelopment at the old Swan brewery site.

 Harvey Perth is growing up um wuh there's a a proposal for two like sixty-storey towers that they'll be two tallest buildings in Perth uh with about a thousand apartments in total  being built on this on this site that's been empty for like the last twenty or thirty years I th I think pretty much. Uh and uh finally a developer has got approvals from all the relative bodies to build these two amazing big towers and I think that's gunna be a watershed for for the city and um I hope that um they get plenty of buyers and uh uh people decide that um that's a good thing to be in uh myself I'm not sure about it but uh.

 What do you reckon they'll sell for  pretty hard to tell now isn't it.

 Look I'd be surprised if they start out at under three-hundred-thousand  and probably y'know upwards of y'know million plus for the for the top-storey apartments probably even even more than that for the  for the penthouses uh y'know I haven't seen the configuration yet so.

 Thousand apartments.

 Uh yeah that's huge  that that's a lot of volume I dunno how they're gunna do it but good luck to them.

 Alright well we'll watch that one with a great deal of interest. Mate thanks to everyone who called us today had a lotta calls  and uh sorry if you tried to get through 'n' you couldn't quite manage it but uh try again next week that's when we'll be back with Real Estate between seven and eight you have a lovely week Craig and I will talk to you at seven o'clock next Saturday morning.

 Thanks very much and luh look looking forward to it.

 And we're looking forward to the news with Len right now and then it'll be our Saturday Garden Party with Sue McDougall.
"
" Good afternoon Howard Sattler with you welcome to the Drive program here on eight-eighty-two Six P R I'll be with you till six o'clock tonight 'n' then uh after that we'll be crossing over to tonight's A F L match. Give me a call if you feel moved nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two. First up an issue that uh should uh interest I think all parents well if it doesn't uh you uh aren't as interested as you should be in your children's learning. The debate on lessons about being homosexual or lesbian in our schools has moved down a few notches to primary school. Story books on gay families and being gay are being recommended for children between four and eight years of age by the state school union to its members. One novel The Family Book talks about adopted families one parent families and families with two parents of the same sex. Teachers and parents were asked to use it to encourage children to talk about their families and the different kinds of families that exist. Another book's called Sissy Duckling by an American gay rights activist has as its central character a boy duckling who shies away from sporting and other masculine pursuits in favour of baking cakes and stage performances. While most callers to the station the other day were in favour of gay rights groups explaining homosexual lifestyles to year twelve health studies students exposing early primary years children to the issues is something else. Sixteen and seventeen year olds are of course nearing maturity at age eighteen they'll be fully fledged adults  but kids from four up till eight are still very much adapting to the basics of life which at their age doesn't include dealing with social issues like homosexuality.



 Alright so what say you nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two uh do you think that the children as young as four should be exposed to the issue of uh being gay and what it's like to lyh to live life as a gay person. Some of the other books uh which are included and all of these books they say are recommended reading for four to eight years old. There was the one I told you about the Sissy Duckling.  it says. Uh theh . Uh King and King and Family  what they say about that . Mm. And the other one Heather Has Two Mummies. Uh an extract from that tells us that . Well one can only speculate thuh that uh they may be in a same sex relationship. There you go. John Barich is the president of the Australian Family Association g'day John.

 Oh g'day.

 Whatta you think about all this.

 Ah yeah bit over the top .

 It sounded a bit innocuous when I read some of those extracts there.

 Mm. Yeah well we've always said that this is a matter y'know for parental uh involvement not not teachers. 'Cos the teachers have got thirty kids y'know of different uh whatever and whereas the parents know y'know exactly what to do so we don't welcome um the teachers uh taking these liberties.

 Okay it's the State School Teachers' Union  that is recommending it to its uh its members to go there  present these books to the children and teach 'em about the same sex relationships now between the ages of four and eight do you think that that's acceptable.

 No not at all and also they are making a big uh sort of jump in logic y'know that  because a person is sissy that somehow he's uh actively s homosexual I mean the inclination is one thing and uh y'know that is perfectly normal but uh to be acting it out is the problem and um I I don't ree I don't see who they're helping by equating sissyness or cooking or things like that with an active homosexual lifestyle I mean it's just nonsense.

 Yeah now one of the reasons they're giving for urging teachers to introduce the subject is that they say homophobia is rampant in many schools would that be right.

 No not at all and they've been pushing this line for about twenty years and they tell you that y'know the high suisrate  rate is because of it well that ih again is illogical because twenty years ago when sodomy was illegal and people were getting bashed in parks and so on hah the the suicide rate was lower so why is the suicide rate going up. I think there's gotta be other factors and and one of them the ih uh this lacks integrity in the whole uh uh teaching I mean if they were telling the truth to the kids you could almost uh say that it's alright y'know but for instance they never tell them the red cross won't take blood from people who're having sex with the same uh uh gender.

 Mm  but what do what what do you think teachers should be saying if a four to eight year old ask questions about a same sex relation maybe they have got two mums at home who are who are couple of lesbians so what should a huh a teacher say  to a four to eight year old.

 Well our point uh has been always that this is the thing that the teacher says this is the ask your mummy and daddy. Y'know it's it's for p it's puh puh parental involvement it's not the teacher the teachers have no god-given right to give these sort of sensitive uh lessons. Mathematics physics chemistry is okay because we hundred per cent agreed on it . But with these issues.

 I remember when I was at school I was at a state school in Sydney when we were about eleven I think it was they started uh to teach us about the about sex I mean it wasn't intimate things but  it was just y'know what was happening to our bodies 'n' all that sorta thing anything wrong with that.

 Oh no not at all no that that's just straight factual stuff but this other stuff's got a high element of choice you see. It's the preferential thing that uh even the gy gay lobby's sorta not clear on that one minute they say it's a preference next minute they say they can't help it they were born like that you see well  they gotta decide what it is if it's a if it's a preference then uh they're not entitled to impose their preference on on on people in a class situation I mean sure they gotta duh uh deal with people who may be sort of extra angry with homosexuals but but that is a a sort of a defence mechanism that societies has  as long as it doesn't go over the top in terms of bashings 'n' so on.

 Yeah I was gunna ask you about that what what if uh a gay child or a child who isn't sure of their sexuality at school is picked upon is bullied because of that now how should the teachers deal with that shouldn't  they be telling the whole class that uh something's wrong with that.

 Yeah they they gotta say that look ih we don't pick on anybody we don't pick on the fat kid we don't kip  on the smelly kid y'know we don't pick on anybody but on the other hand it doesn't uh say that uh any of these things are uh are sort of uh in order I mean even the obese kid y'know these days we try to tell them stop being obese y'know don't eat so many fat foodies. So with this one it's the same y'know the the inclination you see is totally explicable. I mean y'know people have got this uh um ih inclination and uh nothing you can do about it but then what do you do with the inclination. Now if they go behind the the toilets 'n' y'know fiddle with each other then that is definitely not on.

 Mm alright now the education department can say yes or no to this 'n' they say there aren't any permanent policies specific to gay and lesbian issues. The curriculum support material whatever that is provided an inclusive approach to relationship education that doesn't discriminate on sexual preference or gender. Do you think they should get more involved in this.

 I think so yeah that's a bit of doublespeak because uh.

 I didn't even know what it meant but anyway.

 No it's doublespeak. I've been d uh chasing them in fact for twelve months now on teaching more about sexual abstinence in younger kids 'n' also about marriage 'n' they they sort of y'know uh really tell you that n they're not doing this much of it well y'know maybe they should see here they are pushing this and yet on marriage they won't do it because they say that oh uh so many people don't get married well I'm sorry but eighty per cent do get married . So why can't we have lessons about marriage.

 Life skills okay  thank you John thanks for your time . President of the Australian uh Family Association now we did wanna speak with Clive Kelly who is the School Teachers' Union convenor of the Bisexual Lesbian Gay Intersex and Transgender Committee. Didn't even know such a committee existed uh he's the the one who is uh pushing this through the union to the teachers um but he's uh apparently in meetings and uh not available. Um so if you have some thoughts about that yes or no to telling four to eight year olds about uh gay and lesbian relationships do you think that's too young nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two is my number.



 Right first caller outta the blocks is John of Leederville hello John.

 Oh g'day mate. Um I mean this this is just uh I mean The West want an extra ten cents for us to read this rubbish  uh I mean they  tried it a couple of days ago with their um  gays and lesbians in the school and that didn't do any good so they've let it go for a few days then they've run it again. The book's called Sissy Duckling I believe it's written by  a bloke called Harvey weins Feinstein .

 Yeah that's one of 'em yeah.

 Yeah the book is about bullying. It's got nothing to do with gays.

 Have you read it.

 No but I've read a an a review of the book 'n' ih the author the author has a review up apparently which the uh bloh person who wrote the article quoted on quoted from. .

 He is a gay rights activist the author.

 Well that's his that's his business mate it's nothing to do with us.

 Okay but the book is about bullying is that what you're saying.

 The book is basically about bullying 'n' yeah it's if you wanna read anything more about it go onto the uh internet  and go onto a thing called Red Rag  and read it there it's in it's there's a fair bit about it .

 Are y you're saying the book is fine for four to eight year olds.

 Well I'm not four or eight I couldn't  tell you but if it's about bullying I mean kids at school get bullied . And also the other book which is uh which apparently is uh uh causing uh concern it is about all families including the traditional nuclear family which apparently the gentleman or lady who wrote the article tended to leave that off as well.

 Okay.

 Uh I mean .

 Selective reporting is that what you're alleging.

 Yes.

 Okay thank you very much thanks for your call John of Leederville that's him uh Jody of Carramar good afternoon.

 Hi Howard how are you this ih today.

 Alright thank you.

 I'm agreeing with your last caller it is uh they're literature about all different families and I've got a six year old in school now and um I would love her to learn about all families.

 Alright do you know whether she's been exposed to any of these books.

 She hasn't yet uh my mother also works as a librarian for um E S L and if that sort of literature came into her work she'd probably pass it on to Chloe. It's not they're not teaching homosexuality  what they're what they're showing kids is that there's different families and different ways of living they're not telling them what happens in the bedroom . They're explaining the families.

 If if they started reading a book to your daughter called Heather Has Two Mummies the story of a little girl named Heather and her two lesbian mothers would that faze you at all.

 It wouldn't faze me at all. Sht my daughter doesn't know at six doesn't know what happens in the bedroom what she's learning is that it's okay for this young girl to have  mothers that young girl then doesn't get teased  and picked on at school because she has two mothers 'cos they're learning acceptance. They're not learning what's happening in the bedroom they're learning acceptance of all families and all things.

 Wouldn't they ask what uh a lesbian was.

 It duh wuh I doubt it says lesbian in the book I haven't read the book I douh I don't know. But if they did that's when it's up to the parents to deal with that and explain what they think their child can understand.

 Could you  explain that to your could you explain that to your six year old.

 I doubt that if it was literature for a four to eight year old that they would loose use lesbian in the book . And if they did then I'd I wouldn't go into the sexual references I'd tell her that it was two women that loved each other the way mum and dad love each other.

 Fair enough thanks very much.

 Thank you.

 Jody of Carramar. Marie of Morley.

 How you going Howard.

 Alright thanks.

 Um basically what I wanna say is that I think the kids should learn about this stuff I mean I finished high school two years ago and we had one guy who wouldn't dare come out and say that he was gay even though pretty much everyone knew he was.

 I think it it's in this one it's a question of at what age should they learn about it Marie.

 I totally agree with that I mean I think you can go around a different way like not straight out coming 'n' talking about lesbians 'n' gays but I mean a book saying y'know this little girl's got two mums 'n' it just brings them more awareness of it not really telling them d'y'know what I mean.

 Would it make it appear normal to most kids.

 I think they would be a little confused  but I mean if some little kids come out 'n' say oh yeah I've got two mums ih the more they talk about it the more they are gunna understand it.

 Yep alright so if you had a uh four to eight year old  would you mind this sorta literature being read out to 'em.

 Probably not for a four year old probably around an eight year old yes but yeah I agree with not at four years old I think it's a bit young.

 Yeah  thanks Marie.

 No worries thanks.

 Nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two if you wanna have your say about this uh it is an issue that uh affects all parents or parents to be and uh therefore I think uh you wuh might wanna comment if you're in that category. Paul at Beckenham hello.

 Hello how are you.

 Alright.

 Um I  I um I've got some pretty strong views on this so I tr I'll try 'n' stay within the mainstream talk.

 That'd be a good idea.

 Yeah um I I the one thing that I don't like about all this is as you just said there a while ago that this is normal . As as it's not a normal thing I'm a man my my wife is a woman. To me that is normal and I think it's it's my right as a parent to teach my kids what is right and what is wrong. And um I I I really believe that that that what they're trying to promote is wrong and there's no way that I'd wanna be telling a four year old kid that that type of thing's acceptable in society. I I think the gay 'n' lesbian community just went a little bit too far by saying that they're normal so does that mean that I'm abnormal because I want my wife to be a woman and.

 Uh I'm not s sure that it actually preaches that that's normal or that anything's normal they're just telling about these are the sort of situations in which children might find themselves . They might have two mums.

 Yeah but yeah the thing is okay you can have two mums but then you just you're just you're leading kids down a path. And and that's the thing and then ih  if if kids kids are wavering well that's okay to go 'n' do that then that's fine because we've just accepted that as a society.

 So when you say you're leading 'em down a path t to what.

 To to to to the homosexual side okay I I I'm most of your callers are gunna think I'm a bigot 'n' that type of thing but I just think that I'm normal because I I I think that if I'm in a relationship it should be with women and women only. And and I don't want my kids to be told that that it's alright for them to go and have a relationship with the same sex and  to have two mums or two dads is is acceptable .

 Or or is it just about tolerant t tolerance of what is not maybe normal to a lotta people.

 N but the thing about it is I think that's where we've gone a lotta things in society it's it's it's I can take parallels of like kids going getting drunk at fifteen 'n' sixteen. We just say that these things are normal now so everything just changes all the time but the thing is there's there's certain normal things in life 'n' 'n' man and woman that's normal. I I don't want my kids to think that they I'm I'm gunna go 'n' divorce my wife 'n' go 'n' get another bloke as a husband because.

 So what would you say to your child if uh she had had Heather has Two Mummies read to her where Heather Heather's mummies are Mumma Kate and Mumma Jane she come 'n' said hey dad I was at school today and uh they're talking about a family where there are two mothers w what does that all mean is that okay. What would you say.

 I wuh I would say no it's not. I I would say that that's not what we were intended for. I.

 What would you say that that's uh ih abnormal immoral  or what.

 I would say that's abnormal and immoral. And and the thing that I really feel that way is I I had no problems with gay people  but when they started coming out 'n' saying that they were normal  that's telling me that there's something wrong with me . Because I don't I don't wanna go and have a relationship with a bloke.

 Alright Paul thanks very much.

 Thank you have a good weekend.

 Yeah you too nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two if you want to have your say about this issue it's twenty-two past three.



 Phone is just about ringing off the wall at the moment people wanting to talk about uh what we teach our kids particularly little kids four to eight years old should we be teaching 'em as is being proposed about same sex relationships. Rex of Maylands hello.

 Yeah g'day uh Bob innit.

 No it's Howard he's gone he's g.

 Oh oh I'm sorry Howard  it ih it's the first time I've been on I'm a bit  nervous but I've come down from up the bush I've lived up there for years 'n' it's so good to listen to a talkback show but  I wuh I I been wanting to ring up uh uh uh uh a lotta times and and what I wanted to ring about was these V R O for men but the young guy that just talked on the phone a minute ago  he's got more balls than any man and and I admired him now I'm sixty-four years of age  I got a son five and I got one three  both boys now I tell you what if anybody starts teaching 'em that crap about the other stuff I'm normal 'n' so's that young man that was on the phone a minute ago to you. And oh that's the way my sons'll be brought up a man and a woman and that's the way. .

 So what happens if uh y you find out from your boy that down at school they've been reading him books like this.

 Well uh I'd be straight down there I tell you right now. I I I'd be the first one down there. And I tell you I've b I've been around the mill a few b few few times I've got a young wife she's only thirty-four  and as I said I'm sixty-bloody-four 'n' 'n' 'n' no I mean I've brought up I got three other daughters. They've never had they've never got pregnant thank Christ 'n' w they were brought up in the sixties 'n' seventies  and I taught them right from bloody wrong from the start and at least each and every one of them have had their children and got married and I'm really really proud of them and these little boys of mine are gunna be the same way around mate.

 Well ah Rex thank you very much thanks.

 No listen I wanna tell you one thing .

 Oh n don't wanna talk about violence restraining orders now because.

  I wanna tell you a quick joke.

 Yeah oh g okay a joke'll do.

 Okay. Did you hear about the new Irish Airways they just had they were allowed to come into into Australia for the first time. Anyway they were flying into Perth 'n' the conning tower there was a lotta cloud over the bloody skies 'n' everything. 'N' the conning tower called up he said Irish Airways Irish Airways he said you can't land yet we'll have to get you to circle round the airport so he says can you give me your height 'n' position please. So the little Irish bloody pilot gets up 'n' he says I'm five foot two 'n' I'm sitting up the bloody front.

  I thought that was coming thank you very much  Debbie of Mirabooka good afternoon.

 Good afternoon. Um I was listening a few minutes ago and um I heard one of your callers by the name of Paul being rather irate about what's being taught in our schools  and what's normal and not normal.

 Yep  what he thinks is normal and not normal yeah.

 Yes yes um  I I take offence to what he said um mainly because uh he was y'know saying that he didn't want his children to be led up the path  now um uh I can't understand that comment because y'know ih ih it's not like uh anybody who ih who is gay or lesbian uh or anything like that ih is  thah that that's not a choice that they made. They didn't decide that well I'm gunna toss off going with blokes I'm gunna go with women because y'know um I've decided that that's my option. Um that's rubbish. Uh for some people being gay or or or however you wanna term it is normal and that's okay. Um and that's the thing um we've gotta stop picking on our kids because they don't fit into a square box  they're a round peg.

 The the issue mainly is whether or not four to eight year olds should even be exercising their minds about this sorta thing whatta you think.

 Uh  I don't think they need it shoved down their throat no. But I also don't.

 Yeah I'm I'm I'm questioning the age that's what I'm questioning.

 Yeah at that age I don't think they need it shoved down their throat is my comment.

 Yeah thanks Debbie we'll have to leave it there 'cos we've got a lotta people wanna have their say 'n' one's Tony of Como  hello Tony.

 Yeah how you going mate.

 Alright.

 Uh I just that Paul bloke he's not a bigot he's probably mainstream Australia mate . Good on him and like that other bloke said he's got the balls to say it. Now if my if my child was to become homosexual or whatever  I would I would deal with it when the time come but I don't want it pushed down his throat at school.

 Would you  ostracise them would you kick 'em out.

 No I wouldn't no I I'd I'm I'm a I'm a lateral thinker ih there's no worries uh we would deal with it . And he's my child and I love him and and we would deal with it but I don't y he doesn't have to be exposed to this at this age.

 Yeah you reckon that's too young.

 Oh bloody oath it is.

 Thanks Tony  thank thank you Elaine of Kalamunda good afternoon.

 Yes I'd just like to say one thing that's about daddies in the family. Daddies are important what male role have kids got to follow  if they don't have a dad in the family they need dads 'n' mums and particularly the boys need a daddy's role how're they going to have a daddy role and know what to do if they don't have a dad in the family.

 Do you think young children should be told that it's uh it's acceptable to have two mums instead of a a mum and a dad.

 Well unfortunately with remarriage 'n' all that some of the children do do that you end up with two .

 But is it something that all the children at school should learn about uh when they're only four to eight years old.

 Well only one woman gave birth to that child so they're really only one mother the other mother's adopted or a stepmother um.

 Or a lesbian partner.

 Or a lesbian partner which I yeah that's not the way it was meant to be . But I'm concerned about kids not hemh boys particularly not having a male role. I was down at a picnic on perh South Perth foreshore back when the weather was a bit clearer and I heard a little one little three year old boy say what's a daddy . And uh that cut me because I thought where is daddy.

 Yeah well these days there're a lot of 'em in that category thank you very much for your call we'll take a break time for news headlines John Nichols.



 Well you're on Drive with Howard Sattler but I'm not alone Matt Birney the opposition leader in the state parliament has joined me in the studio for his uh regular segment which sort of trips between Thursdays 'n' Fridays or whatever depending on your commitments sir. How you going.

 I'm well Howard how're you going.

 Good what do you think about uh four to eight year olds in our schools obviously primary schools being talked uh taught about same sex relationships.

 Look I've gotta say Howard that I think it is political correctness gone mad quite frankly. And uh I remember saying in fact in my maiden speech to the parliament some years ago uh that the biggest problem facing this state at the moment was political correctness because it has literally gone mad. And when you read stories uh the likes of which I read in the newspaper today and yesterday with respect to the issue that you're talking about you can only shake your head 'n' say that political correctness has gone mad.

 This has come from the State School Teachers' Union and its convenor of Bisexual Lesbian Gay Intersex and Transgender Committee.

 Yeah look uh very interesting sounding committee I uh I've gotta say um  uh I'm really not sure why the State School Teachers' Union would have a committee of Bisexual Lesbian Gay and Intersex um uh or or a committee of that name I I don't know uh what their role is quite frankly but all I can tell you Howard is that when I went to school ih we were taught about maths 'n' we were taught about English 'n' we were taught about history uh and we were taught about all of those sorts of things. Uh my very firm view is that these issues with respect to homosexual relationships 'n' gay 'n' intersex 'n' transgender relationships uh are best left to parents uh to deal with in the the comfort 'n' the privacy of their own homes. I really don't think these are the sorts of things that we should be preaching to our kids uh at a school level.

 Does that apply to also to the year twelve students who're being uh given lessons by the gay 'n' lesbian community uh about uh the sort of things that they encounter in their lives.

 Yeah look I think it does quite frankly uh I think uh y'know you go to school uh to to get educated to learn about those things 'n' particularly at that level you're talking physics you're talking chemitry  you're talk uh chemistry you're talking mathematics uh and those are the sorts of things that you should be able to leave school with your mind around. Now I I just cannot see uh why we would be teaching kids at any level in schools about uh intersex relationships 'n' homosexual relationships I mean call me old fashioned if you like  uh but uh as I sit here today I remain to be convinced of the wisdom of doing that but can I say uh Howard you might recall I think about uh two or possibly even three years ago uh Jim McGinty 'n' the Labor party put their gay 'n' lesbian law reform bill through the parliament. Uh I might add I was a very strong supporter of parts of it particularly uh the parts that made it illegal to discriminate against gay and lesbian people in A a public place or B the workplace I I voted in favour of that clause I spoke very strongly in favour of it but one thing that I raised at the time was the issue of education. Because prior to the Labor party putting that bill through the parliament it was illegal and and I'm quoting now from the act of parliament it was illegal to promote or encourage homosexuality in schools. Now Jim McGinty actually removed that clause from the act therefore uh removing it from the law in Western Australia and at the time I stood up in parliament and I said why would you be doing this why would you be removing a law that says it shall be illegal to promote or encourage homosexuality in schools. I said is it your intention to do just that. He basically laughed me out of parliament saying look we don't intend to do that at all it's just that sometimes inadvertently you refer to these things and it's illegal. Uh I said at the time that I didn't believe him and it would appear that I have now been proven to be correct because it would appear that we are doing just that promoting and encouraging homosexuality in schools as a result of the Labor party's legislation that they passed through the parliament three years ago.

 Alright Matt Birney's in the studio to take your calls so if you wanna ring him about that issue you can nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two another one I want you to comment on if you please uh the uh attorney general has decided that one Robert Excell uh is going to be kicked out of this country I think he's been in jail for about thirty-seven years he's a serial paedophile and in prison uh it's alleged that he attacked a teenage inmate by the name of Paul I know his name's Paul because he called us on the program yesterday 'n' this is what he had to say about the state government uh going to uh kick Excell out without even a court case over his alleged attack.



 Well out of sight out of mind uh our government our state government kicks him out sends him back to Britain where he was born and we don't have to worry any more but maybe some people over there do and Paul says why not hear my evidence uh charge the bloke 'n' I'll go up in court 'n' I'll give the evidence whadda you think uh should happen.

 Look uh I'm I've gotta say I'm not aware of all of the details of the um audio that you've just played I have followed it in the media as as you have no doubt uh I understand the police couldn't find uh enough evidence to go on with that particular issue. Uh but look there are a number of other things that need to be considered in the context of this whole debate. Um firstly just as an aside I might say uh I was just reading the life and times of this fellow and uh it says here that in nineteen-seventy-three he raped a nine year old boy th I'm referring to the uh West Australian newspaper . And he got five years jail for that now I've gotta tell you that five years jail for raping a nine year old boy I think is almost a slap in the on the wrist. Uh he he was then released uh on parole and uh some time after nineteen-seventy-seven uh he did the same thing to a child that was eighteen months old and uh and once again only received a relatively small amount of time in prison so uh just as an aside I've gotta say I'm very disturbed about the amount of uh time he was receiving for those uh those particular crimes but uh I think what we can take out of all this Howard is that every time this fellow is released on parole he goes 'n' rapes somebody.

 So it'll be a British person this time round probably.

 And and look that's the thing that's I've gotta say is very disturbing. I mean why is it that our state's attorney general is prepared to inflict this bloke on the people of Britain but he's not prepared to inflict him upon the people of Western Australia now at some stage we've gotta be reasonable about this 'n' say look if this guy is a threat then he's a threat it doesn't matter what community uh he uh he might potentially threaten. Uh so I I'm just I've gotta say I'm astounded that uh Jim McGinty's uh considering letting this fellow out of jail now I I've heard him talk about the fact that ah well y'know he's he's old now 'n' he's got bad health 'n' he doesn't pose a threat.

 Well Paul says he's still a threat that's for sure.

 Well let me let me read to you what Jim McGinty said in parliament in two-thousand-and-two uh when he first decided to deny Excell parole. This is Jim McGinty's own words he said the following and I'm quoting. . And and so what McGinty is saying is not withstanding his ill uh ih his ill health and his age he wasn't prepared to let him out in two-thousand-and-two. He's now using that exact same argument to let him out so y'know Jim McGinty can't have it both ways quite frankly. Um  uh I I've gotta say I'm very very disturbed about the possibility of this fellow going back onto the streets uh and particularly in light of the fact that McGinty himself has said and I quote . A moderate risk. Now surely you don't let people out of jail until they don't pose any risk.

 Exactly. Alright we'll take a break 'n' then some calls nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two if you wanna talk with Matt Birney he's here to hear from you it's fourteen to four.



 Let's get to the phones because a number of people wanna talk with Matt Birney the opposition leader he's here to uh respond to your calls Arnold of Cannington hello.

 G'day Mr Howard.

 I'm uh juh I'm just Howard 'n' he's  m  you could call him Mr Birney  if you.

  Mr Birney.

 Yeah.

 Yes Arnold how you going.

 Thank you uh th thank you for talking to me Mr Birney  uh just just a couple of things 'n' I don't I want anybody to think that I'm discriminative or either or w any of the other but a bit confused about something I know the Labor government made homosexuality in this state at least uh legal. Does that mean they're now trying to make it compulsory . Uh and also uh do do they do does this also apply to the Islamic colleges 'n' the Muslim schools that we have in this state because there seems to be no cowih curriculum correction there and uh they must be laughing at us all the way to the bank. Thank you sir goodbye.

 Thanks Arnold look th that is the problem of course with political correctness because uh as soon as you accede to political correctness uh you then open up the floodgates and uh you just don't know where to start and stop and uh that of course is one of the problems with uh with the issue that we're dealing with today where do you start 'n' where do you stop. I mean as far as I'm concerned as I said earlier Arnold that schools are to teach people about maths and English and history and physics and chemistry and all of those things that you need uh in order to secure employment uh in your future life uh and uh I've gotta say that I'm disturbed uh about what I've seen over the last couple of days but thank you for your call.

 Thanks Arnold nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two Matt Birney's here to listen uh and lor and comment Lorraine of Woodbridge hello.

 Oh hi is that Matt.

 Hi Lorraine how you going.

 Oh hi Matt luh you're like a breath of fresh air you really are. With your common sense and and just logic y'know. Um I j I just agree with you wholeheartedly with what you said regarding the teaching to children of y'know the two same sex parents 'n' and and the the rest of it it it's just ridiculous um my daughter has pulled her kids out of a state school they're doing it in droves because they're not getting the basics taught the discipline taught and although it's an expensive exercise parents are just getting so exasperated and to throw this at kids as well it's just a joke . And y'know it's I don't know where it's gunna end I really don't but I just wanna say keep up the good work Matt.

 Yeah look thanks Lorraine and I guess um that uh I probably break the mould a little bit in terms of uh uh of your traditional party leaders uh I I'm I'm happy to try 'n' tell it how it is uh where I can and uh and to give my views to you uh rightly or wrongly and of course you then have an opportunity to agree or disagree with those views but uh I've been on the record about this for quite some time now but I've gotta say what disturbs me is that um you tend to get a flood of people uh wanting to label you as uh uh.

 Homophobic.

 Wuh well well homophobic or any of those those uh similar words for daring uh to want to interfere with the way that your children are educated at school because this this debate is not about the gay and lesbian community it is about educating our children in our schools.

 The union says 'n' talking about homophobia it's rampant in many schools and the books such as those recommended by the union will only help to foster tolerance and acceptance.

 Well y'know I mean I don't know what place the union have even getting involved in this debate I've gotta tell you. Uh I mean as I understand it unions are there uh to help out employees namely teachers to.

 Not to tell the schools what the curriculum will be.

 Yeah well that's right 'n' and look we've seen in a whole host of different areas unions overstepping the mark. Uh y'know unions in the old days were simply about uh helping to provide a decent working environment for their members namely the teachers. To now have a union come out uh and uh and start promoting this sorta stuff in schools I think is wrong uh and I think is uh certainly uh not what they're there for.

 Alright now.


"
" Well the wait ended for year twelve students today as they found out through the mail or on the net just how they went. What a  a rugged time it is till you complete the exams 'n' you have the big let down 'n' go off to schoolies week and so forth then you think uh oh  the big day we've gotta wait for it well today it came. It's the start of a new life for most of those young people uh they go on to further education or enter the workforce or some of them just chill out for a while. For a select sc uh few a perfect score but for most of 'em uh are happy with a pretty healthy pass. So what does it all mean let's uh find out now from the Senior Secondary Assessment Board of S A uh Dr Janet Keightley that's a real mouthful Janet isn't it.

 Yes we usually refer to it as SSABSA  it's much easier .

 SSABSA sounds much easier.

 Yes it certainly is.

 Well uh your work's done how how  how do you feel now.

 Well our very intense work is coming to an end although at the moment the SSABSA staff are now on the um results enquiries line talking to students who want a better understanding of what their result package actually meant so we're still a little bit busy Christmas day will be uh the time when we'll be able to relax.

 Um the process has it gone uh as in past years pretty much uh to plan.

 Yes this year's process has been a very smooth one um great cooperation between our schooling sectors and the teachers in the schools terrific uh work by the markers who we train and then do all our mark marking and standard setting and of course the SSABSA staff are just magic their commitment to students is just exemplary and they'll put those extra yards in which is what we've had to do and in fact by doing that this year we've actually managed to make it twenty-six days between the last exam and today in the letterboxes.

 It still seems like an eternity though jan dan Janet doesn't it .

 Well from from a student point of view  it might but from our point of view when we realise that we have in fact l had three-hundred-'n'-fifty-thousand pieces of student work looked at in those twenty-six days and my database managers tell me that we've moved one-point-one-six-million pieces of information around to get these students' results out today  so when you look at those figures you think twenty-six days seems so short.

 Uhuh it's a mammoth exercise isn't it  uh do you ever y'know I mean you don't wanna highlight the mistakes and obviously y uh y'know you  in the main everything goes perfectly but uh are there ever you get a perplexed student ringing up saying hey that can't be right because I know I did well 'n' you've given me uh y'know terrible mar marks.

 Yes yes I mean the the issue for SSABSA is that we say that we are human and this is a human endeavour and as a result of that there's two kinds of uh benefit there's a benefit and a d a downside I guess the benefit is when you're sick on the day of the exam we know what to do and we have special provisions and special processes  uh ih the dih uh downside of it is that we also make mistakes but at the moment we believe that we have enough checks and balances in those twenty-six days that we hope that we catch nearly every one of those but occasionally one slips through and students are able to ring us and um apply for a clerical check if they want to make sure that we mah managed to count all of their work all that all their questions were marked that we added it up correctly and so the students can apply for that. Um very rarely do we find that we've we've fallen in a hole.

 Not too many mistakes  well five students didn't make any mistakes at all twenty out of twenty in five subjects across the state.

 Well five students made uh gained an outstanding achievement which was twenty out of twenty I wouldn't say they were didn't make any mistakes  I also wouldn't  nearly they were not  perfect but they have performed in an absolutely outstanding manner and I'm in quite in awe of their performance.

 What is uh this new uh recognition of community policy.

 Well we know that students now are living very complex lives we know that they are very much involved in the community and uh in a variety of ways either through structured programs that are developed by the community meh organisations and sometimes on a personal basis. We've also talked with students about this and we're really sure that there is very serious learning that's occurring in these kinds of activities whether it be a mem a Queen's Scout or a Duke of Edinburgh Award or whether it be with the Country Fire Service or um tt m music uh some of the music boards um there's a wide range of those formal community programs and so now over the last twelve month SSABSA has in fact given students status in their SACE for some of those programs the students can gain up to eight out of the twenty-two units and um we are very careful about ensuring that it is quite significant year twelve level learning that is occurring in those programs.

 It's very commendable trying to to fit that in amongst uh everything else they're doing.

 Yes exactly in fact we know that students are uh many of them are in the paid workforce they are very very committed to serving their communities they take up volunteering roles they s coach junior sports teams they have significant family carer roles I mean your previous caller was talking about nutrition I mean there's a number of our students we now know are the sih the sole carer for another person in their household which includes making sure that they get a balanced diet and they have to understand what it means to eat the five food groups  and so we now ask them to gather that information together to demonstrate to us that they've learnt significant amounts and for that we'll give them a SACE unit towards their twenty-two. So and I must say that this is um uh very very cutting edge internationally for um year twelve equivalent assessments and um we are have found through an international study that this is a very successful way of opening up students' life chances 'n' also encouraging them to continue to learn.

 Janet uh there seems to be an increasing trend to split year twelve into two years uh what are your feelings about that.

 Well it's building on the comments that I've just made about our research into students' lives sometimes I feel tired when I listen to some of them tell  me what they're juggling and they're trying to balance a study and serious work at year twelve they're as I said they're coaching sports or swimming they're um looking after a group of disabled children one day a week uh in their swimming pool or um giving them lessons they're caring family they're looking after elderly parents grandparents or those kinds of things so there's just not enough hours in the day if they were going to do all of those so wuh I find that um being able to accumulate your SACE units over a number of years actually allows them to maintain the standard of a quality SACE and also carry out some of these other responsibilities.

 Janet uh Garry from Novar Gardens wants to know how these people got twenty out of twenty for all five subjects if they made mistakes.

 Ah well twenty out of twenty means that that's absolutely outstanding achievement it doesn't mean that they're absolutely perfect I have to say. They um to get twenty you have to demonstrate outstanding achievement your raw score might be one-ninety-nine out of two-hundred but that is still regarded as an absolutely outstanding achievement so there's a small range at the top there that would give you twenty out of twenty um.

 Has there ever been a perfect score.

 Oh we do get students who get two-hundred out of two-hundred for their examination yes  certainly which means that absolutely every question they answer to the standard that we accepted expected. And I said that.

 Now that's frightening.

 And as I say I'm very much in awe of these students I think they have done a stunning job.

 Janet um well done um  you're coming to the end of of uh a a tough year obviously and it looks like it's all going according to plan and uh there are sixteen-thousand students who can be thankful to you for getting the results out uh ahead of time.

 Yes thank you very much.

 Lovely to speak with you.

 Lovely too.

 Jan Keightley. From uh SSABSA I won't go right through the title of the name because it'll be uh two o'clock before we even get there but um on the subject of uh students who have done incredibly well. James Krumrey-Quinn scored ninety-eight-point-five he studies at uh Rostrevor or studied at Rostrevor and he joins us on the line now James congratulations.

 Thank you very much Graeme thank you very much it was actch if I can correct you there sorry it's ninety-eight-point-nine-five.

 Oh that's uh.

 But that's doh not to worry there.

 Buh uh no well I'd  I'd be quibbling too ninety-eight-point-nine-five.

 So just that little bit away from ninety-nine  which is a bit disappointing because  y'know it's the magic number.

  Now wuh how would it be like for a a a a dumb student like myself 'n'  a lot of the others y'know you get to this time of year  and y'know you get your results and all you wanna know is if you if you've passed or not now you knew you knew full well that you were gunna pass um w were you expecting to get the results you got.

 Tt I guess um it comes uh the the work ethic really is muh is was my indication so basically putting in the time and the effort uh er. The amount of time that I put in uh with that I knew that I was gunna get y'know a a a mark that was um quite desirable and obviously I um putting in uh the uh assignments that we did throughout the year uh were another indication but in addition to that last year I actually did two year twelve subjects as well which is what Janet was.

 Oh no you split the year yeah.

 Janet was speaking about before. And um uh doing those two subjects gave me a good indication as to what the uh year twelve standard was across the state albeit for last year. And s.

 Right so you did four what were the four subjects this year.

 This year uh modern history maths or mathematical studies physics and Italian. And last year I did uh studies of religion and uh German.

 So what are you hoping to do uh once you complete your studies.

 Uh at the end of uh law c a law commerce degree at Adelaide University hopefully crossing my fingers.

 I think you'd  be pretty safe.

  I'd like to think so  but um I'd like to be perhaps uh work in the diplomatic uh field or perhaps uh uh I'd like to travel overseas or or work overseas 'n' 'n' live overseas perhaps uh in the U N or or in the E U uh those sorts of things because I'm I've got a strong uh social justice uh background.

 Ah yes I see you were head of the social justice committee uh prefect of the school.

 Th that's it .

 Um d d any other activities did you find time for anything else.

 Uh I'm I'm actually w at work at the moment so uh I work at uh Booze Brothers the Norwood there and so I did that throughout the year uh in addition to that I was in the senior band at Rostrevor College ah uh ac in fact we toured to uh Darwin this year and a couple of years ago to Queensland  so um y'know amongst the study and also at the beginning of the year I actually went to uh university under the uh Headstart Headstart Scholarship Program and studied German there for the first semester so it's been busy but certainly doing the four subjects was uh doing only four subjects if you can put it that way was uh a a great help.

 I was uh talking oh only half an hour or so ago to a a year eleven student who uh who has got the daunting prospect of  uh doing year twelve next year what sort of advice would you give to uh a student uh approaching year twelve.

 Basically just approach it the same as you would uh year eleven because in essence it's just a step up from uh what you knew er all the workload to be in uh year eleven year ten uh and it's just it's it's gradually a step up and um ih er in fact um tt the only thing that really changes is I suppose the emphasis on exams and the emphasis on these uh major assignments uh which er in fact can be completed throughout the course of the year. And so basically just doh don't stress 'cos you will find the time 'n' in the end it is only year twelve if I can put it that way . Because it does finish and uh like this morning I just I couldn't believe that finally um mm the time to g opening er my results actually actually came it's just uh an incredible feeling that I I never thought would would happen.

 James congratulations uh  well done and we'll look forward to your progress in the future I'm sure we'll hear of you . James Krumrey-Quinn ninety-eight-point-nine-five um scored a perfect twenty out of twenty well done.



 Very good afternoon to you hope we find you well on this uh Wednesday  the day that the students of South Australia found out how they went sixteen-thousand uh students in fact uh completed year twelve exams today they found out we spoke to one young gentleman who obviously has his uh future mapped out in front of him. Let's find another one of our very intelligent young members of the community Nick Smith g'day Nick how are you.

 G'day Graeme good thanks how about yourself.

 Fine twenty outta twenty five subjects you must be feeling pretty happy.

 Yeah no very excited yeah it's good uh it's a good feeling.

 What subjects did you uh do.

 Uh I did maths studies biology chemistry physics and English communications.

 Did you do them all this year.

 Yeah I did.

 Certainly had your work cut out.

  Yeah no it was uh it was good fun.

 What school uh Nick.

 Uh St Peter's College.

 St Peter's College so you  highly recommend the school then .

 Um definitely yeah some great teachers down there.

 What other things did y I mean in a school like that you're usually sort of committed to sport 'n' and other other activities what sort of other range of things did you do.

 Yeah um I sort of balanced my year with a bit of sp with uh with some sport um football 'n' cricket. Um and also some music as well um which was good y'know duh y'know d offered me some time away from study um and that helped to relieve some stress so that was good yeah.

 The subjects you chose to do are they leading you in a particular direction.

 Um hopefully medicine in the future um and I think yeah I'm y'know aiming for Adelaide but I've applied everywhere yeah.

 I suppose that's what you have to do these days mind you you should be able  to pick and choose with uh twenty out of twenty.

 Yeah no I was yeah I was uh it's very helpful certainly yeah.

 What did you find uh the most important factor in completing year twelve to to keep you on track.

 Um I suppose having sort of a realistic view uh about how much study I could do 'n' y'know how long my study sessions were 'n' y'know if I ih I only did about six hours at a time at most um so y'know to have a realistic uh y'know a look at the bigger picture sort of uh helped me through it all.

 How did you cope with the stress.

 Um oh I think I coped y'know alright I had my sport and music 'n' y'know that sort of helped to relieve some stress 'n' that was good. Um and family and friends y'know they're y you I was supported by some great people so yeah ih I I didn't find uh stress was a big problem no.

 I think it's uh pretty important to keep balanced I mean uh year  twelve is important and your results are important but  life does go on doesn't it uh did you  have any time for social life.

 Yeah no I did um so I yeah sort of fitted that um around my studies as well and that was good y'know that sort of uh helped me to get away as well.

 Are you gunna uh get straight into uni or take some time off.

 Um I wanna get straight into uni. Yeah I sort of um feel as if I wanna take this y'know the next step right now um so yeah hopefully if I if I get into medicine I can do that.

 How about work have you fitted any work in amongst all that.

 Um no I haven't been able to get a job actually. Um I'm gunna try 'n' get a job  orderly at a hospital soon yeah.

 Um 'n' what form of uh medicine interests you.

 Oh y'know I'm not that sure at the moment um I think surgery but uh y'know I'm just gunna make that decision when I come to it.

 Well Nick congratulations to you that's a fantastic performance.

 Thanks Graeme.

 And it's uh obviously been born out of a lot of hard work  and a  and not a an inconsiderable amount of grey matter. Congratulations  to you.

 Thanks so much Graeme.

 Nick Smith. Twenty out of twenty in five subjects ah dear oh dear some of us can but dream  eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh if you'd like to give us a call and uh someone who's done just that is Grant from Gilles Plains g'day Grant.

 G'day Graeme how are you.

 Fine thanks.

 All the best for you 'n' the sease for the festive season to you 'n' your family 'n' I hope uh two-thousand-'n'-six is a better one for you especially.

 Thank you I'm sure it will be.

 Further I'd like to wish all the uh year twelve students all the best 'n' hopefully that they got what they wanted in reference to results because um uh we had the um  trauma uh bleak pleasure of it last year with our daughter . And all I can say is anybody that's into year twelve next year in two-thousand-and-six to the parents just let 'em go if they wanna stay ims in their bedrooms lock themselves in the bedroom just supply 'em with food 'n' drinks 'n' so forth  if they're willing to study and do it.

 Yeah m actually my two boys have gone through it my my second uh lad completed year twelve last year had a different attitude to it and treated year twelve like any other year and he got through but um it wasn't traumatic but you're right there it's it's really up to them isn't it what by the time they get to that age they're they're b gunna make their own decisions make their own way.

 Tt oh yes yes yes. Graene  mone  of the wain  reasons I wanted to rih or the main reason I wanted to ring you today was um unfortunately it's hit the front page of today's paper and on it's also on page five is the Graham Johncock situation in the courts.

 Right.

 In actual fact if you look there you'll find that the uh Advertiser's running a debate do you consider j Graham Johncock's penalty to be too lenient. Three weeks suspension 'n' a thousand-dollar fine plus the fact two-thousand-one-hundred dollars to the police 'n' the victims. I actually think it's absolutely disgusting that he got three weeks suspension. For the fact that um um these are my views not the views of the radio station Five double A because of the situation with Bob Francis which is going through at the moment  what's the judicial system cuh coming into when you get somebody that's been suspended for three weeks 'n' a thousand-dollar fine.

 What uh I I have no idea of what the standard fines are do you have any idea of what the  the average sorta fine is.

 Uh I've got no idea what the standard fine is um look don't get me wrong I follow the Crows with the wife 'n' so forth 'n' things like that but when you see a photograph of John Reid uh Geof Motley uh following I think in reference to all this football should stay with the club it should stay behind closed doors in reference to um anything to do with the sport 'n' anything to do with this with um .

  to say that John. Anyway uh we'll have to to leave it there Grant um I think uh those comments that uh you've gone a little bit too far as for John Reid 'n' uh Geof Motley supporting him I think that's uh entirely reasonable um just because they're visible people you know who they are but a lots of people appear in court for different offences and they have family 'n' uh maybe business associates in support uh quite logical that um if uh someone's a member of a football team um if they get um called up for whatever reason that they get support from the club I mean it just happens uh that way I I don't think that is at all unreasonable.
"
" Been to the city lately tried to find a park maybe you've gone into one of the council's own car parks 'n' footed the fees there or perhaps it is that you've parked out on the street and found that indeed there are new parking restrictions that apply uh and that with the time you require to do your shopping you're probably gunna cop a fine. It is having an impact those in the know believe and we're joined now by Stirling Griff from the Retail Traders Association welcome along Stirling.

 Yes good afternoon Nicole.

 Nice to talk to you for the first time this year and no doubt uh first of many during the year.

 Look I'm sure that's likely to be the case though one thing I do need to mention though Nicole is that the R T A itself hasn't existed in this market for about twelve months. Most of uh the council we're still continuing to meet on a regular basis but uh not officially as the Retail Traders Association.

 Okay so you still uh is ih it's under a banner but not under that official banner  essentially.

 Absolutely there was a lot of politics going on between New South Wales and Victoria and all of us decided frankly that we didn't want to be associated with it so uh. Anyway we're still involved in uh key issues with the city and also uh retailing generally in South Australia.

 Well and it's good to have a voice for those issues because we understand how important they are talking  about issues  is it your belief that parking is one of the reasons that some people decide perhaps not to make as many trips into the city centre as they otherwise might.

 Look absolutely and it's it's been that way for  many years and shoppers choose a destination due to its accessibility and the merchandise offering so if it's difficult to find a park or parking costs are high they will definitely shop elsewhere and the last thing any retailer wants is to lose business. Now the interesting thing is that it's not always got to do with the cost of parking a lot of it the majority of it really is accessibility and that's signage 'n' people knowing where the best parks are 'n' so forth.

 Well and we've also had significant change as well and and what happens then is that it throws people out if there's a place that they used to park and walk perhaps it might have been a small distance into the city where they're no longer able to park for the same time frame um people decide sometimes it just gets too hard.

 Well you are right 'n' and the interesting thing with that is that we're all territorial when it comes to parking  and I'm sure that if you think of of where you park  uh you're bound to go to uh  uh a particular um car park and you always want to get your park on that same level  'n' if you can't get it you get very frustrated so . It's quite uh quite funny how we all work that way.

 One of the suggestions uh I noted from comments in the paper today from the chief executive of Harris Scarfe Robert Atkins is that perhaps if the council is going to be reaping such rewards through parking fines they might look to reinvest that uh to reduce the costs of long-term parking which is what then attracts shoppers to the city area is there some  merit in that.

 Yeah look there definitely is uh ih ih there was a couple of points that are that are worth making on this the main issue is the lack of short-term free parking uh y'know you go to any major regional shopping centre and there isn't a problem 'n' and many people who receive fines are not long-term parking offenders they are shoppers or or business people who have for one reason or another been held up a little and have been nabbed with a fine. Now at the the very least there should be more leeway with time for these people perhaps an extra ten to fifteen minutes over the expiry time but the big issue and and the important um uh way to move this whole thing forward is that many of us have have felt for many years is for the council to encourage people in the city by making all of their car parks free for the first hour and then increasing the cost progressively in subsequent hours.

 Well you've got my vote . Love the sound of that.

 Yeah I mean that would make a huge difference to the city and uh it would benefit everybody including the council for revenue I would imagine.

 Uh and I uh it is interesting because I think you're right where it's something quick that you want to get in buy get out or something that you need to do it could be simply a paying of a bill whatever it might be y'know putting some money onto a lay-by um  you're you're less inclined to do that where you've gotta pay peak for for zooming in and zooming out.

 Yes yes definitely I mean uh and every year the city's retail share of business declines now a big contributor to this is accessibility like parking it's also followed relatively closely by limited food and grocery offerings because people don't come to the city for their weekly shop. They tend to v visit more for general items 'n' the likes but improving parking accessibility is number one on the list followed next by the cost of parking in the city.

 So Stirling with a great suggestion like that where are you going to take it I mean what's  the likelihood of of getting uh the various councillors to nod in approval.

 Look it's something that uh many of the key retailers around town in fact uh the associations have all lobbied for it's well and truly time for us to get back into this issue again and really it's quite simple just make the first hour free at council cark parks and the second point would be to look at ways to improve accessibility like having signage that updates frequently with locations 'n' the number of parks available like you get in many markets interstate and those two factors alone would uh make a huge difference to uh market share of the city.

 Well we'll perhaps try 'n' do our part by uh tackling the lord mayor on that issue and see  where he stands I thank you for your time Stirling.

 Good on you. Bye-bye.

 Stirling Griff. Eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh I'm late for my news headlines I better go there and then I'll come back with your calls is it parking that causes you to perhaps shop elsewhere do you find it a pain in the butt when you're looking to come into the city simply to do something that you wanna do quickly zoom in zoom out do you find that it's just too hard so you simply don't bother uh and of course there have been some changes to parking in recent times as well that have put in additional restrictions areas like I'm sorta thinking along Frome Road way where you were able to park for a longer period of time so you could park there wander in y'know not pay car parking fees 'n' I know they're not significant in comparison to interstate but some people don't wanna have to pay them and I understand that y'know budgets are tight. Uh they put in restrictions and I find now driving into work that a lotta those spaces are simply left empty it seems great waste to me.



 Okay let's get straight back into your calls on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh Nicole Haack with you through until four o'clock this afternoon indeed each and every weekday afternoon and lovely to have your company with me for my first day back today I hope you'll stay with me right throughout the year 'n' I hope you'll uh phone through as well we certainly encourage those telephone calls good afternoon Paul.

 Yeah hi Nicole welcome back.

 Thank you kindly.

 Um just about uh car park in the city I actually live in the city  um and yet I won't go shopping at Coles the Central Market or Central Market simply because there's no car parking around I will drive to Unley to do my shopping or Kurralta Park.

 Is that right so you ih you actually drive away from your home environment.

 Yeah exactly um  and the other bad thing about Coles in Central Market is you're not allowed take the uh trolley up to the car park . So y'know you can't do a major week weekly or fortnightly shop because you can't carry it all s even physically up to the car park. Um so I don't go there for that reason but also if I do park there I've gotta pay extra to park there. Um the other thing.

 It's still one of the cheapest in town though isn't it. I mean that's it's I must say  it actually draws me there for that reason because I find that it is and I apr I appreciate that whole notion of actually having to carry the lugg the ih y'know  your groceries.

 That's just a major thing though I mean uh h how do you physically carry y'know weekly or s or fortnightly shop with you when you go major shopping.

 Can you not  go through 'n' use your trolley 'n' go up or up  the uh lift.

 No.

 Okay.

 Yeah which is which is ludicrous. Um well ih unless it's changed in the past few months but I know you couldn't do no 'n' I haven't been na back there because I actually go away from it. The other thing I find really frustrating and friends do as well are a lot of reasons they don't come out they will go to like cinemas or nightclubs in the suburbs is you look around the city and there are so many loading zones and  parking stickers at all times so you get a loading zone y'know for ten minutes at all times and I'm thinking I've yet to see a truck  load or unload at two A M on a Sunday morning . And yet they're not you're not allowed to park there and I do know people who have been pinged with parking infringements at two in the morning on a Sunday  so th they have inspectors out to do that  and you're thinking if you want people to come in at night 'n' try 'n' make the city vibrant 'n' that why not free up these zones make them Monday to Saturday nine to five or whatever. You certainly don't need it on a Sunday morning or y'know at two-o'clock in the morning to stop people parking there.

 Yeah uh what you're talking about there is just allowing common sense to prevail  y'know rather than the heavy hand that comes down and says oh what if we leave it like that we'll probably cop y'know I I hate to say it but I suspect what we're talking about here is a revenue stream .

 Well exactly I mean it was the front front page of paper today how much money they're making from fines 'n' that 'n' you're wondering how much money they're making from that sort of thing by pinging someone at two A M on a Sunday morning who's parked in a loading zone knowing y'know they're gunna get pinged for it but y'know  thinking well surely that's not now but it is and fifteen minutes at all times y'know . Free things up in the city a bit.

 Yeah if you 'cos if you do the sums Adelaide City Council supposedly made an extra million dollars this year in fines uh and they employed eight new parking officers so if you looked at I 'n' I don't know what a parking officer might earn but l let's say I uh I'm pulling  a figure outta my head  but let let's say they earn forty grand a year  or something like that so you've employed eight of those do the sums as to what it's actually driven in terms of revenue.

  it's obviously they're egh they're they're expecting to make well above the cost of employing those eight people  which means they're gunna send 'em out at two A M in the morning to ping people who've parked in loading zones that says at all times.

 Well uh I tell you what happened for for um me the other day 'n' this is whilst I was on holidays actually we had uh we have a a a common driveway at our place and so it's shared with the neighbours but wuh we had friends parked in the driveway um and they pulled their car out so that a person who was parked in the in the driveway could get out and they parked it in the front residential area for say well look it would've been a matter of two three minutes uh and thankfully we encountered probably one of the nicest parking inspectors I have encountered ever actually who actually knocked on the door and yelled out 'n' said look just letting you know I I actually need to fine this car uh unless you're prepared like you're going to move it 'n' we were like oh it's just been moved out to allow another car to get out. Um common sense prevailed and of course the car was put back in but I mean  you're talking a matter of minutes and this was at about ten o'clock at night Paul.

 Yeah I had  that same sorta thing I parked on my driveway which is sorta like a f half the footpath just to unload some shopping so I was inside for like five minutes come out 'n' I've got a parking ticket.

 Yes . They're out there.

 And yet directly opposite me is um two-hour parking zones and I actually rang the council one day nuh last week because there was a car that'd been parked in wuh same spot in a two-hour zone for over a week and they'd never receive a ticket not a single one . So you think alright y'know I park for five minutes in my own street y'know  in my own house to unload somebody parks all day every day 'n' they don't get a p ticket.

 Wasn't your week for buying a  buying a lottery ticket that's for sure .

 Certainly not no.

 Pleasure talking with you Paul.

 Thank you  bye-bye.

 Hello Greg.

 Hi how are you.

 Very well thank you.

 That's good I was just ringing up to talk about my ambitions for this year.

 Absolutely.

 Yeah well the firh first and foremost is I need to get myself a job for thuh a thirty-eight hour job so I can start paying the bills that I'm behind in . And secondly I can I can start saving some money so I can marry my beautiful lady by the end of the year.

 Aren't you gorgeous.

 Yes 'cos we can't we we can't set a date 'cos we haven't got the money to do it so .

 Well I certainly wish wish you all the best in that regard.

 Thank you very much.

 How long you been looking for a job for Greg.

 Well I was I'm I was outta wur I was uh working up until Christmas time but I got  I got a lovely Christmas present  told me my services were no longer needed . So y'know the work wasn't there but that's fine.

 Isn't it harsh that it always seems to happen I mean I guess cuh companies reassess as the year winds down but it's just the it's it's the most tragic time to do it to anybody.

 Yeah and I've ah y'know since then I've put my name down at job agencies and I mean th they try 'n' help you out they get you a day's work here or there but it just does it's not enough to keep you going or even to save some money  so.

 What sort of work you looking for Greg.

 Well I've I have a forklift licence so  I can y'know operate any f any kind of forklift um and j just general labourer work if if necessary I could y'know I I'm pretty um open in that s y'know sense where I'll I'll try anything 'n' give it a go.

 Yeah you'll put in the hard yards 'n' do the hard physical work if you need to.

 Yeah and if I can't do it well so be it I've given it a try  y'know . Theh theh.

 Greg and that's all somebody can ask of you someone who's prepared to give it their best shot.

 Yeah that's right.

 Uh  look wuh with an attitude like that I'm sure it won't be too long before you're back out there and uh and uh giving it a good run. And  hopefully by the end of the year Greg you've you've got the ring on the finger.

 Yeah well I hope so.

 I do too I wish  I wish you all the best 'n' look if there's anyone listening in uh this afternoon who's looking for someone um who may be able to get out there 'n' and do the labouring work um we'll pass 'em on to you Greg.

 Well I hope so is there any way that yeah I could leave a number for you.

 Sure can I'll pop you on hold you can leave that with my lovely producer Monique.

 Alright thank you.

 Good on you. Uh good afternoon Peter.

 Good afternoon welcome to the new year.

 Thank you kindly and to you.

 Uh thank you. Just thought I'd I'd try 'n' pass some positive feedback regarding uh regional operations regional passengers into the new Adelaide airport.

 Sure please do.

 Um I had reason to be on a a Rex flight uh from Kingscote back in uh a couple of weeks ago on a hot day. And it was uh about thirty-three passengers onboard clearly the majority were from Norway uh Sweden. They were obviously on a on a a large trip . And uh we got back into Adelaide and not all of them were young and it's a fair hike through this maze from the tarmac uh once we got into the airport proper we're faced with this screening process because Kingscote Ceduna Port Lincoln don't have screening facilities . Now alright fine jobs to be done we accept that but the the attitude of uh 'n' this is where the feedback I hope to provide  the attitude of of Chubb Security was was almost c aggressive uh towards uh these overseas visitors and and certainly uh there was a gentleman in front of me who would've been in his sixties carrying uh a set of X-rays and no hand luggage he was clearly into Adelaide for a medical interview and they decided that he should have to take his riding boots off to have them put through the scanner.

 That that's actually r really commonplace nowadays I might say because um uh uh oh and I don't know what it is that's in shoes obviously y'know you understand where they're steel-capped but I've got various shoes where when I wear them  um they always go off 'n' and you see every time you go to the airport you see people taking their belts off 'n' their  shoes off  'n' and the like um and and they're not calibrated the same either because one pair of shoes that you'll go through one airport with will go off 'n' they won't in the next . I can't quite figure that out.

 The the the point being I I take your point but the point is he he wasn't young he clearly was in pain he was offered no chair  he was set up in front of uh of the rest of us particularly the overseas guests and there was an almost inaudible tangible no don't do this don't make him do this . The man was in pain uh they insisted that this be done. Uh we know that manufacturing is declining in this this country in the next four five years  we have to be smart about what we offer uh the world uh to attract people in uh and tourism clearly could be one of those those ventures for this state and this country and uh we we all pay a surcharge uh for security and we I think pay a surcharge to help fund what the interest payments for this new airport  and uh I I think uh we need to look at the distance that the not so young uh m m communih members of the community look at the distance they have to travel inside the airport as well as this very long walk uh from regional aircraft. Um a a number of these tourist centres are gunna be serviced in future years  uh at the far end of this this new airport 'n' uh if we are contributing a fare surcharge on every t uh every ticket that passes through Adelaide perhaps we can look at uh an extensh extension of that peramrilator that uh the the t travelator or whatever they call it.

 Sure and uh alh the alternative option as well is uh and I've seen this in operation in um several of the interstate airports is the little buggies that they  y'know transport people on um if you're you have an injury or you're in some way not in a position to be able to walk a distance um they'll take you from one spot to another on one of those.

 And hopefully they will look at that I mean we I don't need to s s uh I don't mean to to to bucket them uh it's a new enterprise uh as you said earlier this afternoon one will've thought they would've looked at best practice around the world. Uh hopefully they have 'n' theh 'n' are 'n' they are succeeding in a number of areas with that. But certainly the long distance for regional uh passengers elderly passengers and and uh I would encourage Chubb Security to uh look at some in-house training 'n'  'n' 'n' maintain the right attitude. A job has to be done ag.

 That that's  spot on actually Peter that's where I'd come back to it's about how you approach it isn't it no I  I must say also in line with that um just uh h just yesterday um and it wasn't wasn't Adelaide airport it was another airport but  um there was a uh a lady coming through and and she was confused as to why she was going off 'n' and uh instead of actually explaining that y'know she needed to remove this that 'n' the other it was it was an aggressive approach that was taken to her um it wasn't Chubb Security it was another security firm but um it it's all about I guess y'know maintaining the right demeanour and and keeping that balance between um oh uh I guess just making things easier for people as opposed to y'know understanding that there are going to be some some difficulties that you've gotta encounter due to security reasons but making it as easy as possible and balancing that up with  the security needs. Yeah Peter you enjoy the rest of your afternoon.

 Same to you thank you.

 Ta ta.

 Bye-bye.

 We're gunna take a break 'n' come back with more eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh when we come back actually some tips on what to look for investmentwise if you got some spare cash. Most of us don't but if you have got some spare cash what should you look at for two-thousand-and-six.



 Got any money and you're looking to invest it's always good at this time of the year to take stock so to speak have a look at where you're at financially have a look at uh how you might prepare for the future. And if you are an investor of course you wanna have a look at what the trends are 'n' what uh sectors might be hot for the year ahead that being two-thousand-and-six of course 'n' we're joined now by the director of Prescott Securities David Middleton welcome along Dave.

 Welcome well thank you very much Nicole.

 Uh I guess as always the markets change from year to year those things that are hot one year might not be the next and uh part of your job is to keep it uh abreast of all of that what can you share with us at this point in time.

 Well probably the it comes as no surprise to anybody that nothing's really cheap at the moment there's no  there's no fantastic bargains in property there aren't any fantastic bargains on the share market it's uh it's it's one of those uh one of those situations where um whilst nothing's like extremely horribly expensive either theh it's pretty hard to find bargains you've gotta be really looking towards buying investments that have got a m a m a reasonable prospect of doing well in the longer-term.

 Mm so so that's the key isn't it to n to not be looking for a a y'know a sh a short-term gain that may indeed have some pitfalls with it but to understand that maybe you should be looking what would we suggest five to ten years down the track.

 Well we quite like looking at things that way we think it's more m uh five to ten years is a bit more predictable than five to ten minutes really and and uh and things can be moving along in one direction but uh it may not and you might make money in the short-term by sort of just hopping on to the to the nearest tram but sooner or later it can it can uh reverse on you and then you run into problems so thinking about what's m the sorts of of investments that you might like to own that have got a a real future we think is the way to go about it especially when markets're as they are at the moment.

 So at this point in time are you able to pinpoint any particular industries.

 Well hmm h uh w it's it's more the it's more trends really uh I was listening to the uh chappie that you were talking to before about the airport and he was talking about manufacturing industry declining in Australia well that that really comes as no particular surprise because you've got this enormous competition from the providers of cheap labour in in China and other parts of the developing world. And the fact that a lot of our manufacturing is now being exported offshore is actually quite a good thing because we've got a a sh a shrinking workforce here in South Australia or about to have a shrinking workforce in South Australia and so we actually need to shift from manufacturing of goods 'n' st uh to other to other sorts of things. And so  try to avoid uh investing in companies that are subject to to competition from China and from India and those sorts of ah sorts of places is a good idea and looking for to invest in industries that are that that will benefit from increasing world trade and and moving goods around uh we think they're pretty good.

 So transport and logistics is one example perhaps.

 Well  yeah we think so and and another is r the f everybody knows that the population of Australia is aging but they immediately think that they need to invest in funeral directors. But the reality is that that uh ten years ago or even fifteen years ago sevent sevent being seventy was old now being seventy is kinda the prime of life. And and so we're we're living longer but also we're we're w with all the advances in technology where we can get replacement parts 'n'  and and pills to help us do everything from um enjoy an active sex life to to various other sorts of functionality means that we've got a a growing market amongst uh amongst retired people there'll be almost twice as many retired people in ten years time as there as there are now so sort of focussing on the on the sorts of things that that that s s uh mature im um consumers invest in um is is pretty sensible.

 T certainly makes sense doesn't it we we've got about uh thirty seconds to go but just ih one other area I note of interest is that of child care.

 Well there's the d the the rate of population uh or sorry the birth rate increase for the first time 'n' we've got governments uh giving tax atseh uh t incentives to use child care 'n' the need for people to stay in the workforce and all of those things seem to us to make child care an area which is which is a rapidly changing area that is worth watching and perhaps investing in.

 Well let's hope that it's a positive year ahead uh we'd like to perhaps catch up with you a little down the track thanks David.

 That'd be great Nicole thank you.

 Director of Prescott Securities David Middleton.



 Ow what a wonderful afternoon it is a gorgeous day here in Adelaide and wonderful to be back with you. Of course Nicole Haack with you through until four o'clock this afternoon still plenty of time for you to get involved today and we wanna have as many of your calls as we possibly can that's our aim for the year ahead to get you involved as much as we can through your emails your faxes and indeed most importantly your phone calls on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh. I've said it earlier I'll say it again too if you have some suggestions about what you might like us to discuss if it you've s been listening for a period of time 'n' you've been thinking gee I wish they'd talk about this or they've never raised that why not send us through an email and let us know or a fax we'd be happy to take up some of those subject suggestions for you and certainly give you credit in doing so uh we'll try and accomodate as many of those as we can throughout the year this year because we wanna get you directly involved because this is your program you drive it so let me know what it is that you'd like to hear us talking about eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh uh we've raised certainly a number of subjects with you this afternoon and still keen to get your perspective on some of those I wanna know whether you think a national I D card is a good idea or not uh are you one of those people who's somewhat fearful as to how that information may be used somewhere into the future as to how secure it might be concerns that indeed if we've got all of our information stored in the one place could I D fraud be easier. Uh would we in fact facilitate uh those who are looking to steal other's identities as opposed to work against such things as terrorism you may have a perspective on that one I'm I'm reasonably comfortable with it on the basis of saying that I would like more information you can never make up your mind until you know exactly how something such as that is going to work but I wanna in hear what you think eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh also interested as to whether parking is an issue for you coming into the city. Are you concerned that there is too many fines being handed out too many restrictions in place and that the ease of parking or indeed the opposite of that is what causes you to make a decision to stay in the suburbs if that's where you live. Uh and also today I'd like you to share with me what your desires 'n' dreams are for two-thousand-and-six it might've been a resolution that you made but is there something specific in particular that you'd like to achieve this year or like to see happen something special to you that indeed you wouldn't mind sharing with us. Eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh.



 Good afternoon Richard.

 Hello there uh  there the uh I D card uh where wih  er it's not needed really because uh if uh y  if you could have the uh if everybody  in Australia  or is it especially the new immigrih immigrants  could be uh tt uh natural naturalised uh you know uh  yeah naturalised or uh. Be an Aussie citizen.

 Ih it's it's about though being able to identify yourself at a particular point in time.

 Yeah well well if everybody could get uh  oh a citizen be a citizen where we it's automatically on your card.

 Got it accepting/excepting of  course Richard that we have we have people living in this country who may never become citizens of the country and may never be in a position  to be able to be.

 I'll I like to say this uh all these all these um uh terrorist suspects that were arrested  by the police  if they g suh if they cuh uh wanted want all these rights put put to them  well they should uh be a Aussie citizen then all the rights would be accepted . You know that.

 I think the thing is Richard and and this is of course we've seen examples of this happen that is that uh people will say whatever it takes and will be of huh oh a certain character or appear to be of a certain character in order to get Australian citizenship um only to find that they are actually working against everything that this country stands for later down the track and and then we get into that whole discussion of whether um the citizenships should be revoked 'n' whether they should be deported um I've expressed an opinion on that previously that's fairly clear and that is dh I I believe so the problem is where do you send them to. Um but I y'know I h I think that there's I guess some r related issues there but I think also regardless of whether you're a citizen or not you might be a citizen um it still doesn't necessarily mean that you're you're effectively able to identify through one card all of your f I guess personal details and that's what the I D card is supposed to do um and that's supposed to deliver I guess greater security some argue that it might do exactly the opposite though. Richard thank you for your call good afternoon Kevin.

 Hi Michelle  uh I'm the uh first-time caller but I've got some tips that might help some of your uh listeners. Um I've been retired from air conditioning and refrigeration for many many years but because people can't get fridge mechanics or air conditioning people  they're contacting me.

 Is that right.

 To come out of retirement  and I said to one person uh that uh said well my frost-free part's not working and I said well go to the down there and tell me is the fan working at the back . And  said no I said well you don't need a refrigeration mechanic you need electrician to replace that fan . That's all that's gotta be done but because that causes your frost-free . While that little fan's blowing that stops the frost from forming on the uh on your freezer.

 Well Kevin you've probably just saved that person and uh and many others a substantial amount of money beause if you called out the wrong person they'll still charge you a call out fee only to tell you that it's someone else you need.

 Yeah and another one contacted me they've got out their old  mother's um Bonaire and uh they said we're sitting in front of it 'n' they've put the water in and uh sitting in front of it they felt all wet and sticky and I said well um did you try the humidity control  there all that does in there there's clamps off the the uh water so that  it clamps off so the pump doesn't pump the water up over the top and down and then the the uh the blower fan blows across that and that's what gives you your cooling so I said go and tip your if the humidih humidity control's not working tip your water out down in the uh bathroom down in the bath and just use it as a fan . And another one um.

 Oh you're  a wealth of information this  afternoon Kevin.

 And another one is that people don't clean their filters on their air conditioners um you take the cover off and take the filter out 'n' shake it and uh and you can wash it if you like and then put it back in but if you don't  the air can't circulate through and that becomes a block of ice.

 Spot on actually I had that uh very problem in the last house in which I lived the air conditioning system was costing an absolute fortune and never seemed to be able to keep up with things but um h I indeed needed to point the finger at myself because I was responsible for not having cleaned the filter for a for a fair period of time. Fixed that one though Kevin um thank you for fixing other people's problems this afternoon as well.

"
" Lawyer Bob on the job merry Christmas.

 Merry Christmas Leon.

 And if you have now this is your last opportunity before the program breaks up we are going to recess on the twenty-third but Nick Xenophon and Graeme Goodings will be joining us over the next three weeks to keep you company 'n' those issues that have been uh hot ticket items very much on the burner. But if you've got a legal question to which you'd like an answer in plain English pick on the expertise of Lawyer Bob a a very very good lawyer with over twenty-five years experience practising with seven others at Camatta Lempens in King Williams street. Hi Margaret good morning.

 Good morning Leon and good morning um Lawyer Bob I've listened to you but this is the first time I've really needed your help.

 Okay Margaret let's see if we can help you.

 Quick and easy uh  a friend of mine um  um father passed away. Left the house and a small amount of money to that person but there was a um a brother involved who hasn't seen his father for twelve years plus never done anything. He got left a small amount of money now he wants to contest the will. How are we gunna  what's our chances .

 Margaret your friend does need to get some uh legal advice  and see a lawyer.

 Have have got that  and and the lawyer is willing to go witness because the father didn't want to leave this son  anything  but he did leave him a small amount of money.

 Well you see w what what the the lawyer has to do is is to uh have a talk with you and have a look at uh the reason as you say why your father didn't give your brother as muh ih as much or that the brother of the uh of your friend as much money as uh as he has to the uh to the to your friend and they'll look at the conduct of the uh son  uh to see whether there's anything that's he's done over the years whether he's perhaps been given money by the parents before whether he's perhaps uh used the p the parents as a guarantor 'n' gone bankrupt 'n' they had to pay up money or whether he's been violent to them he'll they'll have a close look at his conduct uh and if there's found that there's been some conduct that's uh um disentitling they call it disentitling conduct well then that will affect whether or not he'll have a successful claim or not but look muh uh Margaret it is something where people do need to get legal advice on they do need to see a lawyer uh it's gunna be a matter in the Supreme Court it can be an expensive affair there will be a settlement conference though to try and sort it out before it goes to trial and hopefully they can sort it out there.

 Nineteen to twelve Lawyer Bob on Five double A good morning to Bill hi.

 Ah good morning Lawyer Bob.

 Yes Bill how  can I help you.

 I just want to I had an accident in September . Um where my car was written off now it's simply a fact that um I was up to stationary at traffic lights I  move when the green signal went abuh turned gr when the signal's turned green. But someone came through on a red and um and actually my car was a write-off.

 Right.

 Um now what is the position.

 Well ih it depends I suppose whether the other vehicle agrees with your version of what's occurred .

 Well uh the the uh female driver admitted um full responsibility to me and  to a police officer.

 Alright well Bill are you covered by insurance yourself.

 Yeah.

 You are look you should probably notify your insurers as well because uh what's gotta happen ih is whilst the other driver will be liable for the collision you may find they c might try to say that your you have some uh percentage of uh of liability in relation to what's occurred um so I would suggest if you're covered by insurance perhaps leave it to your insurers 'cos there's a fair bit of of money involved here. If you haven't got insurance though what you'd do then was you'd go 'n' get your car assessed or or work out what the write-off value of the vehicle is uh and what the salvage value is and then send a uh a letter to the driver of the other vehicle saying they're liable for the uh collision and that uh you want them to pay the amount uh d within twenty-one days.

 Okay Lawyer Bob here giving you legal advice on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh now I've res referred quite a lot of people to you in the last couple of weeks.

 You have Leon yep.

  Uh just a couple of the cases you've looked at.

 Yeah look a a c a couple of matters actually very similar uh where um uh people have uh split up uh they've been married for many years or been living together for many years and decided to uh to part and uh they parted amicably I mean there's no uh great uh arguments going on and they've agreed on on what uh the property settlement's going to be. Now there are difficulties in in not getting legal advice in relation to your property settlement. I advise people that that look you might be uh friends you might have uh separated amicably but you really should get a proper deed drawn up by luh by a lawyer.

 Explain why.

 Well the reason is this Leon because if you don't do it the your your ex-partner can always come back next year ten years twenty years time and make a claim against the property against your property 'n' you may have accumulated a lot more assets by that time and their argument may be well look when we did that settlement back in uh in two-thousand-and-five you never told me about your superannuation or you uh w yih I didn't get proper legal advice as to what was happening you were overbearing towards me all those sorts of arguments can be used but if you get proper legal advice 'n' have a proper deed done under the family law act uh well that can then be used as a bar  towards a claim in the future by the by the partner because each of the parties that has to go 'n' get some legal advice uh to make sure they understand what the deed is about.

 So you even if it was amicable or more than so you wouldn't go to the lawyer together you'd go to separate lawyers.

 Yeah you would need to go to separate lawyers look I I know it sounds as though it's a expensive process to go through but the the way the law is structured in this is is the law wants to make sure that you both have independent representation that you both uh are able to to look clearly at what the other side's got and g and be sit alone and g and get that advice from a lawyer independently to say well look your your husband's got a superannuation uh of about five-hundred-thousand dollars you're entitled to X percentage of that uh you've got children so you've you've gotta look after those kids  uh all those things have to be taken to account so you do need to get some independent advice in relation to it.

 Okay uh Selena wants to know .

 Right uh what criteria well look uh uh a number of criteria. The first thing you've gotta remember is that you've gotta be uh honest with your insurers when you renew your policy or when you first sign up for the policy. If you don't tell your insurers that you've been disqualified previously or that you've been done a few times for speeding uh then it's possible for the insurance company to void the claim later on uh and that does happen from time to time  if you've been convicted of a duh a dishonesty offence you should let your insurance company know because they might decide that they're not gunna insure you any further. So so ih people have to be very careful when they enter into insurances  it's no use paying out six-hundred dollars a year for car insurance if it's only going to be voided because you haven't told the uh your broker or your insurance company the full facts uh of uh of uh what it's about. The other way that a insurance company may uh try to uh to get out of an accident is if you don't co-operate with them in relation to their investigations. You'll find soon after an accident's occurred you'll probably get a phonecall from a private investigator who uh wants to have a chat to you about what's occurred now if you don't co-operate with them  tt uh that th you'll find the terms of your policy say that that that they can then void the policy again so bear bear in mind that you should uh consider co-operating now  there is difficulty with that because if you've committed a serious offence like if you've been uh uh in trouble for let's say uh causing injury by dangerous driving uh well then whatever statements you do give to that investigator can also be used against you perhaps later on if you go to trial so I advise anyone that's charged with a serious uh offence uh with uh driving that causes a accident 'n' there's perhaps people injured they again they should go 'n' see a lawyer to get some uh some urgent advice in relation to it.

 Lawyer Bob on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh now a couple of other cases I want you to mention too that you've taken calls about.

 Yeah luh Leon uh uh Michael was uh was leaving a car park uh and he'd juh just finished using his mobile phone still had it in his uh in his hand as he uh uh turned onto the main road and uh hadn't uh done anything with it 'n' the police then uh stopped him and accused him of using his mobile phone whilst driving on the main road and uh and Michael says well look hang on I uh I wasn't using it I still had it in my hand now the inference is by the police officer of course ih is that well if you still in your hand um you're using it and therefore they've issued a fine against him now he wanted to know what he could do now if he's challenging what the police say 'cos he says well look I hadn't wasn't using it anymore by the time I was on that road well then he's gotta decide to elect to be prosecuted don't pay the fine elect to be prosecuted and then you go to court and then you have to tell the magistrate um that uh that uh you weren't using the mobile phone at that time and then it's up to the magistrate then to make a decision but the trouble he's gunna have of course is is to is to explain well why didn't you put the mobile phone down after you'd uh stopped using it.

 Yeah see Paul Fren makes the point uh from the police that touching the phone whilst you're driving is the problem. So you're gunna need to have a hands-free now remember with a hands-free you can talk on it but if you dial a number with a hands-free you're still touching the phone. So you could only I I suspect in practice  if you're in traffic or driving and you have a hands-free  you'd only answer the phone and be able to talk legally not to get prosecuted 'cos as soon as you touch the phone you're in that problem aren't you Lawyer Bob.

 That that's right that's right  uh Leon it's look it ih it is a uh uh a t a type of matter that that still  not much not many uh cases have revolved round 'em as yet I think most people are paying their fines uh so it's gunna be interesting to see uh whether people will take on the police in relation to these sorts of matters but just bis bear in mind that y'know even just checking your mobile phone to see what the time is  uh  is using  using your mobile phone.

 Hi John.

 Hi um Leon. Um I just wanted to aks  Lawyer Bob Lawyer Bob um can a bank open your account I've paid off my home loan my mortgage I've aksed  for  um to discharge my mortgage 'n' that to close the account I've paid all the fees 'n' everything that they've aksed  for. Then ten days later they've um the solicitors rang them to discharge my mortgages my house p deeds 'n' that  and ten days later the bank rings me back saying that they've re-opened the account and charged me a seven-hundred-'n'-eighty dollar fee for paying off the loan early.

 Alright uh.

 Are they allowed to do that.

 John ih what you need to do is have a look at the original contract that you've got for your loan  uh there will be a a document around somewhere  and and according to that document it may well say that there were penalties involved uh if you do pay off your loan early. What some people tend to do is they just leave a dollar in the um uh owing on the account 'n' just leave it there but I suppose that becomes difficult then if you ever want to uh uh refinance it with somebody else. But uh look have a close read of the contract uh you'll probably find in there there is some sort of formula for for of of a penalty for paying it off early. If you're still unhappy you can always go to the banking ombudsman uh and uh and uh have a talk to them about it.

 And there is a free number a freecall one-eight-hundred number if you want that John look Lawyer Bob can I thank you for coming in today and also for the tremendous amount of work you do off air to help people out you've been an absolute bonzer person and uh everybody wishes you merry Christmas and a happy new year  and we'll have you back in the new year.

  Okay look forward to it.

 Okay. Lawyer Bob from three-forty-five King Williams Street at Camatta Lempens  eight-four-one-oh-oh-two-double-one. Are you uh you're closed during the public holidays.

 Uh yes we are Leon.

 Obviously and what about say the three days Wednesday Thursday Friday up to New Year and then  you.

 Oh I I think we've got a skeleton staff on but uh .

 Skeleton  okay.

 Don't know who answers the phone though.

 Lawyer Bob on Five double A and coming up shortly we'll talk travel with Max Najar.



 It's eleven past twelve remember you can call us on any issue you like on eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh. Uh shortly we'll be talking to Barry Urquhart from Marketing Focus about this thirty-six-hour constant shop till you drop. I'm just interested as to how many people actually do this. Amanda was saying this morning that there are quite a few people who do and if you're one of those people that shopped at two A M now of course uh I suppose if you go and buy petrol at two o'clock in the morning and you go into a servo in a sense you're shopping till you drop you're not just buying petrol you might buy a few other things but when you've got shops open that do almost all sorts of sales at three four and five in the morning are there people that uh will just love to shop because they work unusual hours. Let's ask Barry Urquhart Barry merry Christmas.

 And thank you very kindly to you and all your listeners Leon.

 Does this actually work as a ploy.

 Well I suppose you've gotta ask the question why are they doing it and I've come to conclude there's two reasons why you would extend the trading to twenty-four hours and that is one to increase sales and two to provide sur service and convenience to your customers. Let me address those two issues. In the intermediate to long-term and the sustainable sales it will not uh uh it will not be effective it will be a very gradual sort of situation that will be isolated but more importantly and this is the ins interesting thing that's come out of some recent research that we did uh in Brisbane and in Sydney  what people are wanting if they are wanting convenience is not necessarily to have access to the stores twenty-four hours of the day what would be far better is and here are the three things they would want most of all more staff members in other words not waiting at checkouts more cash desks or registers available. What they would like to do is to interact with better-trained better product knowledge base uh part-time and casual staff because that's what they're looking for rather than extended trading hours and above all else they want staff of stores not to be using the p car parks in the shopping centres what they would much rather them do is to park out of the complexes so that the consumers can go in there and get premium car parking bays that's what people want rather than twenty-four hours trading.

 Barry uh given that you found this out via er uh customer questions why aren't they doing this.

 Well they think that theh uh y'know it's an interesting proposition a lotta people talk about being customer-focussed and uh Sol Trujillo from Telstra recently sent out a little note to his shareholders and he made a very profound statement 'n' I thought my God someone's at last listening I have advocated at seminars and conferences that you don't need to be customer-focussed you need to be customer-driven. Let the customers make the decisions for you now you don't pass value judgements on that 'n' I think that's part of the problem. People are doing things that they've always done they need to sit back and talk to 'em. See convenience must be tied to relevance and it's an interesting proposition but people're saying hold on if I want convenience I can go onto the internet. I've just received some stuff from the British Shops and Stores Association the chief executive's name is John Dean and he said that actually uh the retail sales through the internet are increasing and I'll quote if I may a hundred-and-thirty times faster than traditional High street sales and yet they still only represent three-point-five per cent of total sales so if people wanted convenience and they have access twenty-four hours of the day on the internet they'll go onto the internet they don't want it twenty-four hours of the day they want to interact with people what's lacking and you and I have spoken about this many times before Leon what's lacking in customer service in Australia today is one word personal it means more staff.

 Okay let me ask you this uh we've seen a situation uh and this is uh on to the business of labelling where uh Southern Eggs tell us today that Coles buy uh virtually uh uh the the the lion's share of their product but it's labelled packaged in Melbourne for Coles. Now that doesn't tell the consumer where it's from don't the supermarkets understand that people wanna know where their food is coming from.

 Absolutely and it's an interesting point.

 Well why aren't they doing it.

 Well I uh see  well  uh where are the decisions being made for Coles uh at the moment it's being made in Melbourne therefore they promote Melbourne I'm sorry to say that but it's kind of a a Melbourne-centric organisation that is centralised what we need to be is to decentralise you only have to read newspapers we got some gruv uh vegetables recently in Western Australia which were impregnated with E coli now my goodness gracious me consumers are saying hold on I don't want that merchandise.

 Was that from China was it.

 Uh that was from  uh Asia that's  correct now what they're saying is hold on this is about life this is about quality of life this is about peace of mind and of course the one thing that the buying agent and that's typically the woman of the household wants to do she wants to be able to sit back and say Good on you Mum Tip Top's the One and that implies that she's made the right decision women want to make the right decision she wants to buy locally and it's peace of mind purchasing what gives greatest peace of mind is when you buy locally and you know the people who are producing it because it's all about making the right decision.

 So uh uh again uh if if customers vote with their feet and demand that there is proper labelling will they eventually get it I mean mind you the federal laws are going to change but they've gotta be policed by the state and as you well know compliance is not something with which state governments deal easily.

 Look duh Leon if you sit back and wait for legislation and regulation you follow the herd. What this is a very clarion clear call from Foodland the independent retailers and the small specialist retailers and the farmers' markets and food markets right throughout Adelaide and uh even up to Hahndorf and into the regional areas of Murray Bridge and the like of South Australia to take the metal between their teeth 'n' say hold on this is an opportunity let's exploit the opportunity of being parochial let's really go out there and be serious about being local this isn't about packaged in Melbourne or packaged in Sydney that's not the issue let's start to have it as a marketing tool we'll become famous for it we'll do it in ow our advertising we'll put it at point of purchase and we'll uh see now there's the point 'n' I think it's very key if you put it in your advertising and you put it on your shopfront then that in an aisle by itself will attract people into the store. Once you've got them into the store it's easy the packaging will convert them and reassure them but what I'm simply saying is the packaging should be the third of three or four stages to really utilising that attribute of localism to be your marketing tool and your point of difference.

 Barry thanks for joining us that's uh Barry Urquhart from Marketing Focus on thirteen-ninety-five Adelaide's Five double A. Are you one of those people that goes shopping at one or two in the morning are you going to partake in this shop till you drop campaign which is happening just before Christmas. Eight-double-two-three-double-oh-double-oh at thirteen-ninety-five Adelaide's Five double A.



 Hi Ron.

 G'day Leon uh I work in retail for one of the big two chains and uh believe me it's the worst week of the year to work in retail but uh I wanna make an observation and then a comment. I remember you interviewing Roger Corbett three four years ago  and he pontificated about the creation I think f of five-thousand jobs uh if and when we sort of extended our hours do you remember that interview.

 Yes I do.

 Yeah okay. Now the success of the trading hours now that we have at the moment forget Christmas aside that  uh that we're open till nine o'clock Monday to Friday um now I work in a uh one where there's only the supermarket 'n' a few specialty shops  there's no accompanying sort of K-mart or Target or Myer where you can get a bit of   extra  I'll guarantee Leon between Monday to Friday there is no-one in the store after six o'clock seven o'clock  and as a result  of uh the store I work for or the company I work for where they're just cutting back cutting back cutting back on labour all it takes is it'll be about eight o'clock at night all it takes is a couple of people with two full trolleys and then another dozen or so people coming in with just bits 'n' pieces y'know where they've and you've only got two checkouts going  'n' and you've got a couple of big  full trolleys  and then you get the you can see the the the customers' expression on their faces going oh y'know now grrr y'know sort of uh getting  uh annoyed with it  but we don't put 'em on y'know wuh we'll put 'em on on Friday uh or  extra staff will be put on on Friday specially in say the deli section and the meat  department 'cos the that's the and on Saturday in particular but believe me these extended trading hours Leon I have not seen  people still do the major shop on the Saturday and even the Sunday's not really that big.

 Ah Sunday I I've found even before Christmas Sunday  trading has seems to be quite popular  from from what I mean I've uh I've rarely been if you go to for example the shopping centres  and uh you do it on a Sunday  generally speaking there's a lotta people there . Lot of people.

 Yeah you you get 'em you get 'em at the start of the when it opens at eleven and in the last hour  but throughout the week Leon there's no-one there between six and nine o'clock  trust me and they only just shove on two checkout operators and as I said all it takes is  a couple of people a couple of bih  and you're gunna have people waiting.

 The the the the the shopping hours regulations as I understand them  don't mean though that you have to open it says that you can if you want to . So if  if the big  supermarkets are not getting the customers why not shut.

 Oh but you but you'll see that uh  uh when you're part of a big organisation that they're all open till nine there's none of thih the only thing is uh our shopping centre because it's small  uh our I'll say I'll say who I work for it's Coles  we won't be going for the fifty-two hours uh in a row  business 'n' we'll be we'll be just shutting at uh  at nine o'clock at night  'cos it's not we're not part of a a  y'know a weh a Westfield yes.

 W why don't the why don't the bigger supermarkets the ones with the big market shares go hell for leather in making sure that they label properly local foods so that people know what they're buying. W why don't they do that.

 I I mean I'm not in management uh Leon I'm just uh like um y'know a  a retail assistant yeah uh.

 Okay but but you you'd get some of the feedback from the public on that wouldn't you.

 Oh I gotta say Leon I ih it's more uh I don't g I don't get a lot of those sort of queries they'll say d'you know where this is made and I'll I'll have a look over the package for 'em 'n' if I 'n' if I don't 'cos I don't work in the fruit and veg  but I'm talking about like your packaged goods  I'll I'll have a look for 'em . But generally I I gotta say that's not really I very rarely had uh queries about uh origin but I I've had more where people come in  and because you're a major supermarket they expect you to stock  or they assume that you stock absolutely everything that's ever been invented or created and people come in with some obscure  uh food additives 'n' and you sort of say to them oh 'n' I'm I'm pretty knowledgeable of what we got in store and I'm saying  look I'm sorry I'm pretty certain we haven't got that that's a that's more a uh  a a .

 And and what about  what about the trend towards the bigger supermarkets for increasing uh in a large percentage their own home brand where they exclude a lot of the other popular brands that people used to buy.

 Oh yeah you you you definitely you definitely see that and um a lot of the stuff is just the brand name but in plain packaging  um and ih ih the the dead giveaway is where the packaging is very very similar and the colour scheme of the label  is very very similar you're  basically buying the sa th the same product uh whether Kellogg's or Sanitarium or  or whatever it might be  I mean some some of it is uh clearly offshore  and it's g deliberately the label is very very similar uh to sort of n not to con not to confuse but just sort of uh.

 Of course not .

 To to gr no to grab your attention. But uh yeah um yeah as I said yeah there's hardly anyone in after six  uh you get I I perhaps department stores uh it may be uh worthwhile I figure most people will get their fresh food shopping done by Saturday morning.

 So tell me uh are  the sooh are the supermarkets gunna be part of this shop till you drop thirty-six-hour thing surely not.

 Uh noh not ours no  not ours but you'll find uh I.

 I j I just can't see well I mean you can go you can already go into uh a a servo at some ungodly hour and some of them  have got quite a good range of stuff you pay a bit more for it but you're paying  more for the extra  for the extra  ability for the place to be open.

 Wuh well put it this way Leon I know that the Target near ours occasionally  they have these midnight sales where it's dark  and my wife has gone just for the but she finds that a lot of people that are there it's more a social thing let's go out let's see what's happening  there seems to be a lot of people milling around  but no-one's actually really buying anything  . Y'know yeah it's almost like  it's almost like in the old days before people had television.

 We'll make it look  like we're shopping when we're not .

 They they'd look through a shop window  and watch the ih it's almost like yeah it's pah they get the kids in the pyjamas it's all a bit of a laugh let's have a look around but no-one actually buys anything .

 Yeah Ron thank you for calling in on thirteen-ninety-five Adelaide's Five double A remember you can.
"
" Thank you Len and a very good morning to a ravishingly lovely and relaxed Sue McDougall.

 Very relaxed oh  so relaxed yes.

 I am so envious of you I really rea no I'm not envious of you that's wrong envy's a sin  isn't it one of the  seven deadly ones.

 No you're allowed to say that we say jealous in a nice way  jealous in a nice way yes.

 Because you've  been over to Rotto.

 Spent the week at Rottnest and it was just the best week I mean uh as much as we need the rain  it was we did not have any rain when it was raining in Perth we could see the clouds over Perth and Rottnest is the best spot we had shorts 'n' T-shirt on  Harvey really seriously shorts 'n' T-shirt  this week. Didn't um pack the jumper until tuh no didn't put the jumper on until last night and it was just the most beautiful week it was  still it's just gorgeous they're doing lots of refurbishing at Rottnest so it's quiet like we had the uh Island to ourselves  the lodge is closed  they're putting a new roof on the lodge 'n' the dome is being refurbished so there's lots of things happening over there lots of money being spent over there but it's just happening at the moment of course it's the time to do it when it's quiet so it's just fantastic just the best spot to have a holiday in winter.

 D'you wanna go back next week.

 I'd love to go  back next week okay  I'd love I'd be there I'd be there tomorrow  yeah definitely it is just just wonderful.

 Sounds uh what the doctor ordered.

 Rode around the island. Um that's there's some big hills.

 Sore botty have we.

  Yes . Actually my legs didn't ache so I was lucky about that but um I think it's twuh over twenty kays around the island but it's the hills the hills are pretty steep. And saw lots of whales. There's whales are out there so on the um lookout to the water out to the on the souh southern side of the west end there's lots of whales making their way up the coast.

 Isn't it lovely  um I didn't s I went to Albany the week before as you know  to my daughter's place and and son-in-law's huh had a very nice time there I must say and uh they've got a s very nice house do you know Albany at all.

 Yep.

 Course you do 'cos you come from down there der.

 Well no I don't come from  down there but spent time down that way yeah.

 Um they got a nice house on Mt Clarence.

 Yes.

 Overlooking uh the the beach and  and they can see we invested in a pair of binoculars  for them they weren't getting my nik  they were not getting my Nikon twelve-fifties under  any circumstance  but I did get 'em a little pair of uh  eight eight-forties or eight-twenty-fives  I mean still good and we watched 'n' watched 'n' watched we just didn't quite see any whales there but they they they have been coming  in there.

 Yep  yeah I know it's just wonderful I think binoculars is a good investment . I need a pair too just to have with in the camera bag  'cos often you see something you think wonder what that is so yeah just wonderful.

 It is years since I've been to Rottnest I'm ashamed to say because it is  it's beautiful but and years further on when I actually  did venture onto a bike my recollection of the Rotto bikes were that they were a sort of.

 Pretty bad.

 Well pretty sort of  uh heavy-duty . What are they like now.

  They were pretty bah some are really good  depends you can pay for um basic ones or you can get some um really good ones there's some great ones there but we usually take all our bikes because we've got our bikes  with the bike seat 'n' the trailer we've got a trailer for the kids get a get puffed they go on the trailer 'n' so  going up hills with a kid on the back is pretty hard good for your legs Harvey  my legs have really  gotta keep at it now it was just wonderful and my um little niece went 'n' she learnt to ride her bike there 'n' that was hilarious that was source of many laughs  because she um did some funny things like started  peddling uphill went dow around went nyaoo  went right back down the hill again 'cos she couldn't stop 'n' oh .

 Oh dear. Ooh dear dear dear.

 That was funny that was funny we had lots of laughs lots of giggles 'n' just ate lots as you do um when you're on holidays 'n' just enjoyed it caught lots of fish too.

 That's ih uh did you.

 Mm.

 W when you said you eat lots what is it about holidays ih when I go away o on a holiday  my s stomach forgets it was fed an hour ago   why.

 It does  it's true .

 And you think god I'm hungry.

 I know and you think oh  hang on a minute you just keep eating and eating  don't you.

 Is it because that when you're working you kind of uh you're buzzing  along and food goes into the back of your mind  'n' if if 'n' when you stop  all you think about's your stomach.

 Yep  I think so.

 Mm. We've got some Solvol packs to give away today some Solvol citrus soap packs worth forty-five dollars uh ad hoc to be given away six packs to be awarded today and uh that's great so uh nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two's the telephone number. If you've got a photo that you'd like to send us uh feel free to do so of your m garden or a plant or whatever uh gardening at six P R dot com dot A U. We might open up the batting I think with Alexandra of North Perth. Hello  Alexandra.

 Hi Alexandra.

 Hello good morning to you. I like your probrem program and not just the program but the station I'm addicted to.

 .

 You've just about  I reckon you've just about won yourself a Solvol citrus soap pack  without opening your .

 Without even trying . Well done  . How can we help your olive tree.

 Oh well I'm I've got a olive tree which is home grown from a a pip. It's okay growing and now have a fruit but when the olives start ripening get uh black from the tip up. Then start rotting from the tip up and have fall they off.

 Weh it's rots does it.

 Yeah.

 Has is it happen every year or is it just this year.

 Well uh I notice last year um before a it just l it had little bit and I  didn't notice much but last year's had plenty and this year the same. And it .

 Do they split Alexandra do they split and then start rotting.

 Uh some of them split afterwards they   but really without splitting they start rotting they rot.

 They start rotting anyway. When they start splitting they can they get um odemia . And when they start rotting they split and then so then the um rot sets in from the bottom and away it goes it just goes downhill from there . I would that's just aside from the ones that start rotting anyway what's the fruit like. Uh is it is it edible fruit.

 Oh they are beautiful to eat them when they  not affected you know.

 Sure what I would do then Alexandra when the olives are just starting to um size up when I say get to the right size I'd be spraying them with Mancozeb Plus fungicide unfortunately  you have to spray the tree  there's nothing we can do about that.

 Still green or when they black.

 Yeah while they're still green before they go black  because if they stay on for long enough while they're still green we're going to have to do that to stop it spreading. And you may need to apply it twice you may need to do it when they're just starting to form the right size  and then as theh just before they start to colour so you'd be looking at probably end of March and the mih ih no probably earlier than that middle of March 'n' the end of March . Time to spray with Mancozeb Plus.

 Mancozeb Plus.

 Yep see how you go with that.

 Alright okay thanks very much Alexandra and we weren't kidding you've won yourself a Solvol citrus soap pack so would you like to hang on the line  and we'll put you back to grumpy.

 Thanks very much  I never won anything in my life.

 Uh  well well done you have now.

 Well you've won something now isn't that good.

 Thank you.

 'N' that  might lead to you winning Lotto tonight even Alexandra.

 Ah I don't doubt that.

 Well  I'll go you halves how about that.

 Thanks.

 Okay there we go alright uh we'll take a break it is thirteen minutes past eight.



 Yes I feel like a leak at the moment. Do you mind  me saying that yeah . So I thought what we would do is find out a little bit about 'em . C Christine joins us Christine Simpson from Fresh Finesse hello Christine.

  That one's a little bit hard to top I have to say   Harvey good morning Harvey 'n' Sue.

 Hi Christine  . Well there is .

 What's the difference between an onion and a leek girls.

 .

 What.

 I said I like leeks because I've have a lot of trouble when I'm cutting up onions they make me cry whereas leeks uh still have a lovely mild onion flavour but uh no tears.

 Now  listen can sorry can  I just butt in there for a moment.

 Certainly .

 I've got a solution for you Christine.

 Ih what's that Harvey.

 You need to go down and see our good mate Patrick at W A hospital supplies and ask him for a Zyliss chop chop.

 Ah yes yes.

 They are brilliant  I use mine all the time.

 Mine is virtually on the kitchen bench every day  because there's something to chop up whether it's garlic or oh Georgia's garlic by the way again  digressing ah put that in something the other day can't remember what um it yeah so y you you'll get no tears.

 Uh uh I think I might've had one of those at one stage is it um uh is it electric or.

 No no no.

 No  no you hand one.

 Yeah.

 I the problem with me Harvey is that I only have to look at an onion  and they make me cry .

 Oh no guarantee.

 I don't even get to peel it .

 What you do is it's it's it's sort of like a it's about ahr I suppose uh eight nine inches  high  and it's got a pump action and the thing is that you punch down these cutters and so what you do you put the whole thing over the onion w you don't put oh over a whole onion probably I'd cut mine up into about four pieces.

 'Cos it gets stuck I've done that.

 'Cos it gets stuck yeah 'n' I've done that many time  so you cut it into about four and just  get the uh dooverlackie on it 'n' go  it makes a helluva the duh uh c Harry the cat he fair dinkum nearly hits the roof 'cos he's sorta sleeping most of the time  and when he's not being naughty and so I think this is really good I'm gunna enjoy this now bang bang bang bang bang bang bang and and he jumps hits the roof the onion gets cut 'n' everyone gets on with their lives .

 And you a smile on your face.

 Oh I have to say  it's probably a a better idea than trying to cut onions by hand.

 Yeah well go 'n' see Patrick he'll  he'll do a good deal for you.

 We were talking about leeks the flavour of leeks is so much milder that it doesn't you can you can eat them um they don't overpower dishes do they.

 I think I think that's the advantih another advantage Sue actually and I particularly like to to slow cook them with or caramelise them with a little bit of you can use brown sugar or honey and either some olive oil or batter just in a lovely y'know get one of those nice Le Creuset pots from Patrick I suggest  just the thing for caramelised onh.

 Patrick give us the price we'll all have one.

 What's that Harvey.

 I say we'll geh Patrick'll probably give us a call 'n' give us a price we can all buy one.

 Yes well we could we could go buh go halves thirds ah .

 'T's a good idea.

 And uh I like to once they're all lovely and soft and caramelised and and still uh with that mild onion aroma and then and while they're still warm add some olives and some roasted or semi-dried tomatoes and some thyme-flavoured vin vinaigrette so use fresh thyme it's so lovely at this  this   time of year.

 Mhm.

 Time for thyme.

 And.

 I kept saying to my sister I need some thyme and she's going  huh  she thought I meant normal time.

 Need  some of that too Sue.

 Yeah.

 And.

 I've had that conversation recently  yeah please continue.

  And if you want to turn that into a l a lovely warm potato salad just fold it  through some nice Delaware potatoes are really good at the moment um and just steam still with their skins on nice and chunky and that makes a lovely salad to serve with roasts and grills 'cos it's really it's really winter salad time I think at the moment. Now lemon trees are .

 Ah there's so many er lemons around.

 Except mine of course Sue  but I'll have to talk to you another time about that uh dripping with lemons. And so it's lovely to start the day with a glass of freshly squeezed lemon juice and I like to make preserved lemons for I'm going through a bit of a m Middle Eastern North African d cooking phase at the moment.

 Oh I haven't had that yet.

 Well I keep seeing recipes I've got a recipe for this and I keep saying I must make those.

 I get to  Moroccan lamb and that's about as far as I've got .

 Takes five minutes to do the preserved lemon.

 Does it.

 Yes.

 What do you do.

 Ah that's one for me.

 So and  so two or three or however many you think you're going to need just wash 'n' dry them evenly shaped ones are a good thing and I've the easiest way I think is to cut off both ends  stand it up uh so it's up 'n' down on the bench and just cut it half way through not oh sorry h about three quarters of the way down not all the way through just in half and then turn it to ninety degrees and turn it over and cut it the other way so it's still whole but you've broken it into almost into quarters . Pack the inside of each of all wherever you can with just ordinary cooking salt pack it into a jar and you can do one lemon or you can do ten or however many and then fill the jar with freshly squeezed lemon juice  . And if you leave that for about three weeks you're on the way to Moroccan lamb or chicken or whatever you like Harvey  and it'll keep um for months in the fridge.

 'T's a good idea.

 Tt oh that's fantastic . Now I've also read Christine you can't use um well you need thin-skin lemons or it doesn't matter. Does it matter if you use  Ruic  lemons. Yeah.

 We call them Meyer lemons by the way.

 Yeah Meyer lemons.

 Oh yes  I do too that's what my tree is  um   I do know that much .

 No no no the surprise is that I do .

 Actually that's.

 I'm very impressed Harvey.

 That's interesting speaking of thick skins Harvey because  I read during the week that the the thick-skinned len lemons are best for preserving because  you only use the skin you the you'd actually discard the pulp and the salty liquid and you wash all that off the skin and then just use that  the preserved skin.

 That's why I've been hesitant of of doing them because it says thin skins is best on my recipe book so I'm gunna change that  I'm gunna head down 'n'  'n' do it tomorrow yeah  can use I sure can.

 Which I think are the ones that are plentiful at the moment   and uh preserved lemons are just gorgeous with couscous uh  salads through summer  and also vegie or lamb or chicken tagines any of that  um.

 Wonderful stuff.

 And even great with pasta.

 Yeah.

 Now you've got all this info on your website too haven't you W W W dot fresh F F R E S H F dot com dot A U.

 Dot com dot A U we certainly will from early in the week Harvey .

 Good oh that's fantastic then uh.

 Now you've put me on a spot.

 No that's alright I mean duh it's good to have a bit of a shoofty through your  site anyway 'cos there's lots of good stuff on it.

 It is yes we try to keep up to date and our recipes are seasonal and our product information too so you can get a pretty good idea of what to cook with what's in season.

 Marvellous alright Christine great to talk to you this morning we'll do it again next week.

 Thanks Harvey.

 You've inspired us all again.

 Thanks Christine.

 Christine Simpson from Fresh Finesse it's uh twenty-four minutes past eight  I think we're gunna talk to Anne of Mt Hawthorn in a second  I think we might have a little special treat coming our way at eight-thirty.

 Do you.

 Yes I'm not gunna tell you what it is yet  see if you can remember. We were promised something last week and it might happen. Anne of Mt Hawthorn hello Anne.

 Yes  good morning Harvey uh good morning Sue. Sue I've got a couple of questions the first one is we have got a ponytail and my husband wants to like cut trim it right back and do an X so we'll see if we can get four shoots.

 Your husband can do that that's no problem at all.

 Can we do that now.

 Yeah  can you wait a month.

 Yeah.

 Yeah if you wait a month it's just in the warm weather that's all  it's just the warmer the better now it doesn't really matter you can do four an X at the top of the stem and they will shoot away but not guaranteed where it's going to shoot.

 Okay.

 It might not shoot exactly where it's been cut. It might shoot a v little bit below  so could be two shoots on one side four on one side it just  depends but wherever there's a dormant bud sorry a leaf there's a dormant bud a leaf scar that's underneath so go for it Anne you'll find a beautiful big bushy plant rather than a.

 Yeah it is looking a bit  bit lean and mean.

 Yeah they do they do tend to get like that so I always think just chop them off they'll be much better.

 Okay great and the next question Sue I've got um a beautiful navel orange tree which we had heaps of fruit on . Um we had a couple of oranges that had like um some soft spots on.

 Well you need to get onto that that's bah a bacterial rot that the oranges get  and and.

 A couple of them went bad  like on the tree.

 Yeah and they go on the tree I would spray it with Mancozeb Plus now  as a fung just to kih clean up and kill any spores if some of them go on the tree 'n' hang on the tree just cut them off 'n' discard those . Any that have fallen on the ground 'n' have gone rotten you need to pick those up as well.

 Yeah well we've finished the whole fruit's finished now.

 Beautiful are there any hanging on the tree like  munnif mummified okay just give them give it a it's not going to hurt to give it a cover spray now.

 Yeah can we.

 With Mancozeb Plus  if you need to give it a trim back do all that  then as soon as the fruit sets for next year 'n' it's just starting to colour is the time we need to spray at.

 Yeah to give it a trim back Sue what do we do just cut the deadwood off or give it  a good trim or.

 Cut any deadwood off you lyh ooh cut that out completely  and then the branches if they're outta control reduce those you can reduce it up to a third if you want to Anne  need to get onto it now before the new growth comes the new growth is what the is the fruit bearing wood  for next year.

 What's the best fertiliser to use.

 Uh use a complete citrus fertiliser that is um you can get one that's organic-based and you apply that every four to six weeks through the growing season 'n' the growing season for citrus trees is from August to May.

 Okay good on you thanks very much indeed Anne it's twenty-seven past eight.



 And your tree's grown okay it's interesting we've just had an email from Kevin uh  'n' you've had a look at the ph the photo.

 Mhm I had a look at the photos Kevin 'n' we can fix that. So good to see the photo uh at the same time because there's a saucer underneath that tr that uh pot it needs to um be removed from the saucer and looking at the the size of the pot 'n' size of mandarin tree I'd actually zip out 'n' get a bigger pot for it put it into fresh tub 'n' terracotta potting mix lift it up off the ground so it's not sitting in a saucer of water continually and you'll find your mandarin tree will just bolt away citrus fertiliser  do those things 'n' it will just take off the you can see um in the pot the soil has sunk away from the um top of the pot we need some more soil in there so a bigger pot your mandarin tree looks beautiful and healthy it just hasn't grown so we need some more room in it for the root system.

 So we could've asked Len those questions  'n' he would've said my experience is probably woulda said the same as you did.

 He wuh ih would've done because he's now expert on mandarin trees and lemon trees by the sounds of it.

 By the sound of it  I'm gunna be an expert on eating one of those mandarins very soon.

 Me too.

 Mm okay  well uh.

 I don't know how I'll do it when I answer questions so you have one first .

 Alright Maureen of Watermans Bay hello Maureen.

 Hi Maureen.

 .

 Hello.

 I think she walked  away .

 When I'm calling you.

 Oh no I had it on speaker sorry.

  That's okay.

 Um yeah I just wanted to check um just a couple of things um the slaters in the lawn. Um I was just weeding the other day and they're everywhere in the lawn. Um apart from using those little pellet things 'n' I'm a bit worried about my grandson.

 Sure.

 Um wuh what could we use.

 Do you leave the lawn clippings on the lawn when you is there a lotta thatch on the lawn.

 No well I get a  we get a mow an um yeah we get a lawnmower  contractor to do it but  he takes it away.

 Is it couch lawn Maureen.

 Um it's um uh  um suh uh something S what's it um.

 Saltine.

 Yeah  saltine.

 And how old is your lawn.

 Oh about four four and a half years old.

 Few things you can do there's not a lot of h  a slater's job is to break down dead 'n' decaying matter so if there's a lot of old thatch there the slater finds a beautiful home and the slater will f slaters think that's just wonderful spot to be so  if there's a food source there the slaters are there . There's not a lotta things that you can do to the only thing you can do is put a few pellets in saucers around when your grandson sorta come just overnight let the slaters like they're feeding stations for them let the slaters um be attracted to them to reduce the population and pick them up in the morning. I hate doing that hate having pellets around the other thing that you can do at the beginning of September is vertimow your lawn now the moh lawn's gunna look awful for a few weeks but it will shoot away beautifully and it will also reduce all that thatch and it will reduce the home for the slaters there'll be no food source there so they'll disappear.

 Suh so if I l if I left the slaters is it damaging the lawn at all or.

 Not really  only if they bih in plague proportions  their job is to break down dead and decaying matter it's only they get tender new seedlings when you've planted beautiful new seedlings in in the garden but a f a lawn can cope with slaters.

 Yeah.

 Yeah.

 Um juh just a couple cuh other cuh goh have I got time for a couple of other quick ones.

 Certainly.

 Um the other one was the clover we've got that purple clover which is going mad ih it's only a lih we've only got a small little lawn because we're near the coast um sort of where I'm talking the front lawn seems to be alright 'cos it's a different lawn completely . But we've got this purply kind of clover through .

 With the yellow flower that's that's a type of oxalis and it is awful it's just awful to get rid of.

 Well yeah it seems to be and it was  lih little bit last year 'n' it seems to be twice as bad this year.

 Yeah and it'll be four times as worse next year. Maureen you need to use a broadleaf weed killer on it to knock it around a selective broadleaf weed killer for that's suitable for lawns for couch lawns  or pull it out by hand there's no other choice.

 Oh okay well I  sort of did that last year  a little bit but I mean this year  it's going to be a  even though it's a small juh I mean it's a small lawn area I could probably do it but  it's still a job and a half.

 Yeah that's right  yeah so it's up to you if you wanted to spray it to reduce to knock it on the head and stop those seed heads um setting fertile seeds for next year  because if you get the seeds once they've flowered and then they've got the little seed head they just ping and they just spread everywhere. And that purple-leaf oxalis is the is really hard to get rid of.

 Mm  it's even hard to pull up.

 Uh terrible  terrible so yeah I don't f  I do do  feel sorry for you yep.

 Oh that's good . Um just one other quick one I know you're you're busy um we've actually got two big lemon trees now we're right um not lemon olive trees  we're right on the coast and they're massive like the trunks are sort of uh we're only been here four and a half years and the trunks are sort of like the size of a plate.

 Really.

 Um but they got so big we need to prune them back  but we normally like to do it after winter because  they get knocked around a bit  in the wind . Um is that okay in spring.

 Yeah no problem at all  spring is fine . Yeah you can  you can you can pollard them what we call pollard them so they get chopped back really hard what you'll find happens in um the olive grown reeh growing regions is uh after the immediately after the last lot of fruit is gone they get chopped back really hard. The problem that happens with um being next to the coast that new growth gets ih damaged. What you'll find if you trim them back after the beginning of um sorry at the beginning of spring that's when the flowers 'n' the fruit come so if you don't mind losing some flowers 'n' fruit cut them back really hard but if you do mind losing some flowers 'n' fruit you're just going to have to prune them back  a little bit this year s and the rest next year so you're reducing the plant for this year letting new growth come you'll get half the amount of fruit and do the same thing for next year but to pollard them you can chop them back at ground level and they'll still shoot away beautifully.

  Pardon me  excuse me that's um not a direct result thanks eev uh thanks by the way uh Maureen um that's not a direct result of eating a mandarin that is beautiful what I've just had  beautiful sweet yeah.

 Ah can't wait  to have one I love mandarins.

 Be careful 'cos the juice'll go everywhere that's how nice they are . Okay Yvonne of Leeming g'day Yvonne.

 Hi how you going.

 Good.

 Fantastic.

 Uhuh so I have a question about my azaleas um we've got thirty-odd bushes around the house flowering beautifully but a lot of the bushes the leaves are starting to go yellow and dropping off. Um I read somewhere where um it could be a lack of something in the soil 'n'  throwing blood 'n' bone around might  help it. Is that possibly what it is.

 Is it the older leaves Yvonne.

 Sorry.

 Older leaves doing it.

 Um yes they are probably.

 Yeah. If it's the older leaves doing going yellow with no green veins usually it says there's a lack of nitrogen so throwing blood 'n' bone around's going to help so so you need to add some nitrogen some nutrients 'n' they'll pick that up 'n' green up straight away. Few other things that can happen if your soil is very alkaline your nutrients are tied up in the soil and aren't available to the plant so they're locked away chemically . And when they're locked away then the um nutrients then then not available if the P H is very alkaline ush but usually shows up green veins on the azalea leaves so that's iron deficiency a little bit of green veining um on the older leaves the other thing that can happen is just check the underneath the leaves to see if there's no silvering no blacking blackening so you got black spots on the leaves and also a rusty colour so that it looks like the leaves have been damaged . Grab grab a piece of paper flick the leaves onto a blank piece of paper  and see if you can shee  any thrip  insects they also cause silvering 'n' yellowing on the top of the leaves as well.

 Okay and can we get the soil tested or do you buy a soil test .

 Certainly you can get the soil tested gotta zip down to your local garden centre 'n' they'll more than happy to test it for you  but not for nutrients only for P H so s.

 Alright and if we throw the blood 'n' bone around  or if can we do that now or  do we have to wait.

 It's not going to hurt anything  at all  you'll find that the um blood 'n' bone the only thing that happens with blood 'n' bone is that it's going to give you leaf growth so you know how you get the flowers of the azaleas that are beautiful on the top all you see is um azalea flowers and no leaves  you'll find that ih they encourage flowering sorry feeding them at flowering time is going to push the new growth past those flowers . So up to you whether you even wait a few weeks once the flowers are finished.

 Thank you very much indeed Yvonne it's eighteen minutes to nine and uh actually uh are you still there Yvonne. Yvonne's gone muh. That was Yvonne wasn't it.

 Yep.

 Yeah  okay. Okay um Angelo of Spearwood g'day Angelo.

 Yeah how you going guys.

 Fantastic.

 Good.

 I'm just calling in regards we've got a lemon tree and it's y'know it's a bit it's a pretty good lemon tree but it makes lemons where they're .

 .

 Like there's no juice in 'em.

 They're dry are they.

 Yeah  they're pretty dry.

 Are they thick skin.

 They are very  thick skin . Um we do get like a little bit of like a spotty around 'em.

 Yep.

 Um but other than that they're just you open 'em up 'n' they're y'know they're all very thick skin you can cut a little  bit of juice in the middle.

 What do you feed them with Angelo.

 Ah we just put a bit of chicken manure 'n'  just water.

 Yeah okay. Those ones that are really monsters are they close to the inside of the tree the lemons and they've been hanging around  sort of for a long time.

 No they're all over the place  it's all throughout the tree  we have we have cut the tree back y'know a couple of years ago  or maybe even more twelve  about twelve months ago  but um yeah just ih it just does these and ih they're not some of them aren't round some of them are look like they got uh uh y'know one on one on top of the other  y'know what I mean.

 Yeah now few things that you've got there. How much water does your lemon tree get.

 We give heaps.

 Yeah.

 Dad's y'know my dad just pours it with water because he y'know uh uh.

 He wants big lemons  he wants juicy lemons yes.

 He wants juicy ones.

  Sure  now ch  chook whih what's what's the use of having lemon tree when there's no lemon no juice. Chook manure is going to give you really thick skin because it's high nitrogen we're going t  he's going to have to feed it uh with a complete citrus fertiliser so that's the most important thing. If you've got chook manure it goes straight to the skin forgets about the pulp. You'll find if you give it a complete fertiliser with potassium and phosphorus and iron and copper and zinc and molybdemul  all those nutrients that the plant needs they're going to be taken up in little bits. But if it's just nitrogen you get beautiful big green leaves and really thick skin. Eureka lemon is a little bit prone to it. If it's the older lemons that have been hanging on the tree they've gone through summer 'n' they've been hanging on the tree as well they do tend to stay dry 'n' that's the reason I asked if it's the ones right inside the tree sometimes that happens as well. The other problem you've got is bud mite if you've got one lemon on top of another so they're all joined together in really funny shapes that's a bud mite that little mite gets in and causes damage of the cells and the skin and it all ends up really ah it's the most amazing shapes come out of it but it does demun damage the plant so tt uh when it's flowering this year when it's got that beautiful new spring flowering on it which'd be October November we need to the next lot of flowering we need to then spray it with you can either use pest oil which is which will h help the mites or you need to use a miticide like Maverick and that's going to clear that up. Start a program from August to May so from this week on giving a little bit of complete citrus fertiliser you can give it the chicken manure at the same time Angelo but just give it the complete citrus fertiliser as well and you sure that will make a huge difference.

 Alright Angelo.

 Okay beautiful thank you very much.

 Pleasure Angelo keep the water up to it.

 No worries can I just ask one little question.

 Certainly.

 Okay I've got a mandarin tree  which used to fruit fantastically . Last two years I haven't seen one mandarin .

   It's not rootstock that's taken over is it.

 No no it's just decided to go on strike but it looks  good.

  It looks good does it. Does that  get lots of nitrogen too does it get lots of  chook manure.

 Yes it does .

 Okay cut the chook manure back to that and give it some citrus fertiliser as well 'cos we need to get the flowers and if it looks good that's the not a good thing usually the crappiest-looking mandarin trees give the best fruit.

 Well I tell you what this thing looks like a good plant y'know but  it's just not given us any mandarins.

 Yeah we need the flowers we need something that's going to encourage the flowers but check to make sure that there's no shoots nothing that's shot below the graft too Angelo.

 Okay  no problems . Thank you very much  .

 No Angelo Angelo Angelo I'm gunna put you back to grumpy 'cos you've won yourself a forty-five dollar Solvol citrus soap pack.

  Thank you.

  Our  pleasure Angelo enjoy it.

 Good on you Angelo  it's thirteen to nine.



 Eleven minutes to nine and was I right about Len's mandarins.

 They are superb Len  they are the best Emperor mandarins I've ever tasted.

 Really.

 Yep. I I would they're the juiciest  the sweetest usually they tend to be a bit uh bland I think tastes  I really like the  Imperial mandarins but they they are superb Len you are a star thank you.

 What a genius  okay let's go to Ron of Bentley g'day Ron.

 Hey good morning Harvey good morning Sue. I've got a a ponytail 'n' I had t had to transplant it from a broken earthenware pot 'cos it got too big  into a half a wine barrel . But I put the potting mix on the bottom then I put a f a full bag of uh cow sheep 'n' um chook manure in the bottom y'know  on top of that. Then I put another bag of potting mix 'n' I put  the ponytail 'n' me wife said ah you're gunna kill it.

 Yeah you'll probably cause it to rot Ron.

 Ah.

 Um ideally it woulda been best to have just straight potting mix in there.

 Oh okay.

 What you'll find is the cow sh isn't it terrible when when someone else is right in the family

 Yeah .

  Um .

 Yeah she said take it out so I gotta take it out 'n' take it out don't I.

 I would yeah  uh the reason the reason is is um tt ponytails are succulents they do cope with very harsh conditions anyway they're a type of succulent so they they they need very free draining soil. In  the ground you'd be able to put a little bit of sheep manure or soil improver in the ground 'n' that wouldn't hur wouldn't hurt at all but in a wine barrel even though the wood absorbs moisture tt 'n' it drains freely in a wine barrel it's best to have just straight potting mix in there  so it drains you find that you'll you'll kill it with kindness more so than anything.

 So when she comes home I have to tell her she was right.

 Yeah well well you  maybe just don't even tell her. Just do it.

 Yeah I I'll go  'n' do it now.

 Yeah .

 Okay .

 You'll get reminded though that you weren't right and she was  it'll happen even no matter how you try to.

 Marh I'm impressed because Ron admitted it so  yeah I know these things happen but  that's okay 'cos I think I think we should ease your pain Ron we'll give you a um Solvol citrus pack valued at forty-five dollars 'n' that's got Solvol citrus pump pack citrus bar 'n' hand towel cyclone hand cultivator and hand trowel.

 Ah thank you.

 Mm.

 I'll put you back to grumpy 'n' he can organise it for you Ronnie.

 Thank you.

 Thanks mate  okay we'll go to Claire now of Wembley Downs.

 Hi Claire.

 Oh hello. I was just wondering um Sue if you remember the product you were talking about that was very good for putting down the drain.

 I do I do. The best thing to use is copper sulfate there's a lot of brands around  of different things but if you just get cuppus copper sulfate. Copper sulfate will half a cuppa copper sulfate down your sink or flush it in the toilet  whatever once a month copper sulfate just burns the roots the fine feeder roots there so  it will stop stop any um roots tt getting into into um into your drains it works as a really good preventative.

 And that's good  for putting uh for uh the mould off brick paving  as well.

 It is but in light-colour brick paving if you use copper sulfate straight it will it'll turn a tinge blue so you do need to mix it with water 'n' scrub it. The other thing copper sulfate's really good for if you've got a gravel pathway tt uh any any spots of gravel 'n' you've got pots on the ground 'n' you don't want them to root into um send their roots through the pots onto the paving or also onto the onto the gravel if you've got some gravel around if you spray that with copper sulfate  that will stop that happening as well  regularly it works really well just be careful with copper sulfate on tt soft leaf plants if you've got native violet or baby's tears of anything like that around it will burn it . It will cause a problem.

 Alright 'n' can I ask you just one other qu question.

 Certainly.

 Sorry it's just that we have um four um of oh what d'ya call the uh mm oh heavens now I can't remember what they're called they're the pines the pencil pines  and they're we've just got a group of four separating  our house to next door's and there's just the second one along has decided to die 'n'  halfway down  it has died and I think it might get into the others  I'm wondering what we should do about it.

 Uh  when did it die when did you start  to notice it.

 Just our neighbours just said about a few weeks ago 'n' she said have you noticed our pine and I hadn't and I looked up  'n' I've just noticed now that it's getting further  and further down  for the last two months.

 Ah Claire pines conifers take a long while to die so that could've been damage that's happened a long time ago so it's not probably anything that you've done recently . But if it's died say halfway down 'n' it dies have a look at the trunk make sure there's no borers in there tt  have a look right at the base there's no blackening of the stem no oozing of gum or sap to make sure it's not Ceridium fungus or conifer canker they are susceptible to canker  and there's really no known cure for conifer canker it's to stop the plant stressing you need to keep the water up to them keep the um insects off them keep them well fed and so they don't stress because usually Ceridium fungus comes about becuh as a secondary infection from insect borer or or bark weevil or something like that so we need to  we need to make sure there's no insects on it the other thing you can do is spray it with anti-rot there's a product out called um Yates Anti Rot which is or Phosject which is now the active constituent of those two is phosphoric acid now it's not registered for it but it it works as a preventative you can either spray it to a point of runoff or inject the tree. See how you go with that but make sure but the indicators of um Ceridium fungus is blackening of the stem die back of tops of certain branches and gum oozing sap oozing from the trunk.

 Thank you very much Claire and I think before the break and uh thus the news we'll go to Len of Gosnells hello Len.

 Good  morning Sue and Harvey  how are you.

 Fantastic.

 Um I have a uh and I say I 'cos it was a uh a Christmas gift uh from my wife an old English mulberry tree.

 Oh you lucky thing.

 Now it's three years old it's actually  four years old but it's only been in the ground three years . And uh it I trimmed it back two years ago 'n' obviously it hasn't fruited so  I wanna trim it so it g with the hope that it grows 'n' grows 'n' grows 'cos it's it is doing well but this year we'd like mulberries on it.

 Don't trim it back till after yih it's fruited then.

 Okay.

 That's the key. Otherwise you'll you'll loose it old English mulberry tree tends to not tends to not um grow you don't have to prune it back really hard um they don't grow really long canes the Hicks fancy does grows really long canes 'n' grows outta control but the black English mulberry's very slow-growing. So you'll find the the depending  black English mulberry will fruit in January just after Christmas is when they fruit  prune it then then its new growth comes on and they always hide under the leaves of course as you know  so if you prune it after it's finished fruiting you will not chop the mulberries off and away you go.

 Okay 'cos it's  I mean it's just a mess of branches ih higgledy-piggledy everywhere.

 Yeah they're a lovely tree  they are lovely tree yeah my favourite.

 Okay good on you Len thank you very much indeed for your query about the uh mulberry tree uh we're just about through the first hour so what we'll do is take a break have another mandarin I think  would be in order  another mandarin each and uh then uh Lennie's got the news coming up he of the mandarin tree  and after the news second hour of our Saturday Garden Party nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two is the number to call.



 Thank you Len and thank you for the mandarins they are absolutely magnificent.

 They are.

 No doubt about that .

 They are there's not many left .

 Grumpy's got some I'm I should give a cuh I will I'll give a couple to George because he was  good enough to bring that garlic in.

 Exactly right  we'll swap him. We gave him a prezzie last week wasn't it.

 Did we.

 Yeah the little purple  the purple Neopet  I'm sure he was  impressed with that not .

 No that's fuh that's actually.

 Oh he didn't take it home damn .

 That's turned up somewhere I don't know where it is.

 Oh did it someone else got it as a  present .

 I thought it was still in here somewhere . It was here.

 I actually just appeared from here so I actually don't even know whose it was.

 I don't think George is into purple Neopets.

 Oh don't you think so.

 Strangely enough yeah.

  Strange that. True.

 We'll talk to George about his show coming up after ten o'clock Saturday Morning at the Football a bit later on in the meantime nine-double-two-double-one-eight-eighty-two is our telephone number or if you've got ah um an email to send us then  please do look we should oh dear. Oh goodness gracious me I've got some photos to show you we'll get to Glenys of Balga in a moment. Good morning Sue says Kevin um  now wait on have I done that.

 Done the mandarin one  fr that was from Kevin.

 Yeah suh I know there's an unhappy  puh oh yeah the unhappy plant one.

 The unhappy happy plant.

 Oh dear. Here we go     . Ruthless    you've seen those haven't you.

 Yep seen those and yes you can cut your hibiscus back but it's best to cut the hibiscus back at the beginning of September as it warms up it uh will be better and the unhappy happy plant that strip you've got just cut it into sections that looks like quite a large bit that's been chopped off so cut it into sections about eighteen inches forty centimetres long and cut into the bottom bark with the sharp blade of your secateurs paint it with hormone gel and put it into a good quality potting mix if put in good quality potting mix put five or six branches in one pot strip all the bottom leaves off the top branch will need to have the leaves chopped in half so trip  all those awful leaves need to be chopped away put it somewhere where it's nice and warm if your new pergola is in a position where it's gets the morning sun that is fantastic for those cuttings they'll shoot away  ideally not the best time to grow cuttings for happy plants because it needs warm weather but sometimes these things happen you just make the most of the situation you're in.

 Indeed you do. Okey dokey now 'tis time to say good morning to our good friend Glenys of Balga hi Glen.

 Hi Glenyn .

 Good morning you happy people . And um I wanna talk to you Sue about Swan River daisies.

 What would you like to know.

 Well I'm are you have you moved away from the microphone Sue 'cos it doesn't sound as loud.

 No.

 Okay. Um  I'm growing some in a seed tray  and I know it's a bit early  but I've got them in a mini greenhouse  now it says to move them when they're three or four centimetres high . Now do you think I should move them into pots or do you think it might be alright to put them out in the garden or is it still too early to do that.

 I would go  the situation they're going in Glenys is it a really warm is it protected position no bugs as far as slaters or or snails or anything.

 Huh slaters you must be joking.

  Well then put 'em in pots until they're a bit bigger then.

 Ah 'cos they'll  love to eat them.

 Because they're nice 'n' soft if you've got zillions of slaters they'll just get into them straight away. They tend they they're not supposed to but they will because they're beautiful and soft so  how tall are they now.

 Oh um well they've just broken through so they're like  one centimetre or something.

 They'll be probably three weeks time transplant them  into separate pot even just little separate tubes or hundred mil what we call hundred mil pots so  sorta ten centimetre pots and then by the end of September away out they go.

 Okay.

 Even probably before then 'cos they're gunna grow r so quick.

 Are they.

 Yeah.

 Oh great  'cos I I saw them en masse up at Kings Park at the  Wildflower. Oh they look fabulous.

 They do.

 'N' I've  been dying to have them ever since.

 Yeah good on you . Well done.

 Okay thank you very much.

 Thanks so much lovely  to talk to you Glenys bye-bye.

 Thank you Glenys now to Thornlie  good morning Judy.

 Hi good morning.

 Hi Judy.

 Hello. Um look I'm just ringing up to ask you I've got a um can um um  campilian  rose.

 Chameleon.

 Is it it's the little one that comes  out 'n' changes colour.

 It's a gorgeous rose.

 Yes that's correct  um I've had it in a pot for about four years  and I want to transplant it they I've heard they go better in a terracotta pot.

 They do do better in terracotta is it in a plastic pot now Judy.

 Um  no it's in a glazed pot.

 Yep  the.

 So how do I go about .

 The reason that they do better in terracotta terracotta breathes . Okay now that's really the only reason up off the ground it drains freely but if you don't want to have it in terracotta pot if it's in a glazed pot 'n' doing beautifully that is fine  as long as it's up off the ground 'n' it's draining freely.

 I see yes  it's doing that I just thought it'd been in there for two year  uh four years so I thought I'd um.

 Change it ba have you pruned it yet.

 No no it's just come out in flower.

 Again that'd be right.

 Uh yes  and um I'm just waiting for it to die off 'n' then I'll cut it back 'n' change  it over . Um so how do I go about I've got this .

 Uh what you need is quality tub 'n' terracotta potting mix . Tip it upside down get as much of the root system as possible you'll find that you can just pull some of the root system off  a little bit into the pot transplant into pot lots of tub 'n' terracotta potting mix around wash it in so it all packs down. The plant will not look back Judy the th the most important thing is s is to lift it up off the ground  so so that it drains freely don't put any rocks no bits of bark no charcoal nothing in the bottom of  the pot potting mixes are now designed to drain freely so.

 I see so  terracotta I don't have to get the rose uh potting mix.

 Tub 'n' terracotta potting mix will be beautiful  tub 'n' terracotta potting mix the best thing about it's got water storing granules 'n' wetting agent  added to it.

 And what el what was it called.

 Terracotta.

 Uh tub 'n' ceh terrapotta uh terracotta potting mix and  puh then do I 'n' when do I prune it before I put it in or afterward.

 Yeah prune it before you put it in I know there's probably some flowers on it but you need to prune it within the next few weeks there's probably flowers on it now but if you prune it in the next few weeks it will give you beautiful spring growth.

 You are gunna be very busy Judy so  guess what you've won a  you've won yourself a forty-five dollar Solvol citrus soap pack how about that.

 Oh very good thank you . And could I just ask do I have to paint the pot.

 No uh well up to you you can  paint the poh.

 Uh T V last night where  they're painting the inside of the pot.

 Yeah they do with a sealer  now there's a product out that Yates put out called Pot-Seal  and the reason we do that is to stop the evaporation stop the mois the plants drying out so quickly  the pots drying out so quickly  so if you've got your rose in a full sun position that'll make a big difference.

 Alright Judy.

 Oh yes I'll go to Bunnings and buy that  okay and um I just wanted to .

 Judy we're gunna change our mind about giving you a prize if you don't get off.

 Okay  .

 Harvey you nasty basty .

 Just keep going Judy you're on a roll.

  it's okay.

 Thank you very much.

 No d'you wanna ask something else I was only  kidding yeah.

 I just planted some avenue lavender last October  how long does that take to flower.

 That should flower this ss three weeks time about four  weeks time avenue lavender is a gorgeous hedging lavender.

 Oh great okay then  well it's a great show and thank you very much.

 Thanks Judy you're very welcome.

 You hang on the line Jude okay.

  yes.

 Duh don't go away.

 No fine thank you .

 Righto let's go to Mandurah hello Sue.

 Hi um.

 Hi Sue.

 Hi um I've got a ixoras I've got um about seven of 'em in pots  but they've started dying from the top but not all of 'em.

 Only some of them.

 Yeah.

 In pots.

 Yeah.

 Are there are some branches dying from the top on eah or one plant in one pot's dying from the top and the one next to it is fine.

 Um about three of 'em have died. Um one started dying from the top  'n' it had three branches so I cut the branch off that was dying . Now one of the other branches has started dying from the top.

 Oh not good news how long have they been in the same soil.

 Um we moved house probably about five months ago . So.

 Are they in terracotta plastic.

 No just the plastic ones.

 Have they got a saucer underneath.

 No. Some of them have been sitting on soil.

 Yeah. It may be just a drainage problem the water's not draining in away. Usually when a plant dies from the top there's a few reasons but but the main reasons are if it's dying from the top is either not enough water or too much water.

 Probably  too much.

 Yep I would say if they've been sitting on soil in a plastic pot with all the rain wuh okay July's been very dry but all the rain we've had extra water if you tip that plant upside down I'd say it's probably soggy at the bottom. Those fine feeder roots at the bottom just the water can't drain away lift them up off the ground you I would ruh be re-potting them Sue.

 Right okay um should I cut the dying bit off as well.

 Definitely definitely  yep put it in in a nice warm sunny position  but protected and the ixoras should shoot away soon as it warms up they should shoot away. The other thing that um affects ixoras uh is the cold weather but living in Mandurah I would not suspect it it's the cold weather if it's if you were living in the hills in or northern sort of east I'd be saying uh it could easily be the cold but in Mandurah it's um so much warmer.

 Yeah oh well I'll put it in my mini uh glasshouse type thing.

 Yep good idea.

 Okay now um I'm after some clivia seeds for the yellow one do you know where you can buy them.

 Have a look in grab Your Garden magazine or Burke's Backyard magazine have a look in the classified ads at the back  they uh sometimes have mail order clivia seeds.

 So you can't get 'em in West Australia.

 Not that I know of not seeds that I know of but I'm sure they are around but just not that I know of  so just if you got mail order from over east just give them a ring on Monday I mean if you get the magazine you'll be able to find them or someone will know someone who will be able to supply them for you  . But often um Digger's Garden Club  um advertise in there give them a ring to start with otherwise the classifieds in the back of the magazine should be able to help you Sue . A query lucky bamboo.

 Yeah I've got it like groups of three . And just one of 'em's dying.

 Mm is it above the stem a little bit. Is it.

 Well it's going all the way down the  stem but the shoot is staying green.

 Yeah. You'll find that they get a Pythium fungus which is like a stem rot on them once  wuh at certain times I've had a couple of branches of one of mine do the same thing. It's just something that they are prone to because those those stems are very soft. The shoot on top is still fine but all the cells collapse along that stem they rot 'n' then they're just hollow there's nothing 'n' then a black mould goes around them actually  after um there's nothing you can do to reeh to get that one to recover. Pull it out um change the water and refresh refresh it up nice fresh water and then um just break the top shoot off and then put that back in some water . That's the only thing you can do once it's damaged like that  I think it's with mine it came about I changed the position I had it to a a position that was too cold. Needs to be in quite a warm light position and they do much better Sue.

 Good on you Sue thanks for your call it's sixteen past nine.



 Twenty minutes past nine Kim Hagdorn's arrived George Grljusich has arrived. We'd better give 'em a couple of mandarins keep 'em going  before their show Saturday Morning at the Footy coming up along with Ken Judge after ten o'clock. We get some very interesting letters don't we  we've got an absolute beauty this week.

 I love this one Harvey I had a  big laugh to myself can I read it out . Yeah okay.  .  .

 Double-dutch.

  Yeah that's right    . So this one's neat it's got some good hints if I could read Dutch it's ih actually a good book . So do you think we should give it away.

    I can't even.

 I can't even tell what  what's meant to be silent  'n' not silent.

 Tuintip T T U I N  T I P what's  that mean.

 I think it must mean garden tip  because look at the front of the book  'n' it's tuint yeah there  is and  tuin tuintip  tuin agenda planner and  logboeh ih boek it's called . So that's funny  so we need to find someone who c .

 That'd be funny wouldn't it getting it home stick your glasses on 'n' go uhuh . What've I done.

 You need what go 'n' get new glasses . How do you n even know it's Dutch.

 Duh this is fruit well that's I can read that  that's that's the Dutch word for fruit uh   appels. I bet I know what that is.  . All the Dutch people will be out there ss tearing their hair out.

 Cringing .

 Well if anyone  speaks Dutch w d'you wanna d oh what're we  we gunna do with the book there's not much use for us.

 Who would like a gardening book well we'll give it to 'em  what do you think . 'Cos I know nobody  who speaks Dutch so there we go  but she's also looking for one that will help her . Garden Gurus  um the have written a couple of books Eva they may be able to help you go to any of the bookshops or garden centres they should be able to you should be able to find their books they're written for Western Australia find their books 'n' they will be able to help you with what you can plant now and for the rest of the year.

 Well there you go if you speak Dutch you've gone  and won yourself a book . Genevieve of Dianella's next.

  They need to speak it on on um so we can prove it.

 Yeah.

 Yeah.

 Oh yeah . Becauh they gotta talk to us in Dutch  do you speak Dutch Genevieve.

 No I don't but if.

 Genevieve is a French name.

 If it was in French yes but Dutch no  out of my league>.

 No we haven't  got a French  gardening book.

 Through the holidays no we haven't but I've been ringih uh reading Almost French by Sarah Turnbull.

 Oh have you.

 And it's fantastic book have you read it. It   oh it's  wonderful it's about this Australian girl who sta who lives in Paris 'n' wuh how she goes  yeah anyway tt.

 Okay  what can we do for you Genevieve.

 Yeah.

 I can't believe my luck that I've actually managed to get through .

 Yeah it's not easy is it.

  Uh Sue um  when is it uh alright to uh prune a huge lemon tree when is it alright to give it a bit of a haircut.

 Give it a haircut any time of the year  Genevieve. You.

 No specific time.

 No specific time  aside that you will lose some of the fruit  but usually what happens with lemon trees is that you prune all the upright branches off and  leave the side ones 'n' so  they are fruiting anyway so once they are fruiting then then you just nip the tips of those out they branch  out so  you'll find  that the um citrus are  usually the rule of thumb for citrus is immediately after the um lot o last lot of fruit has been picked off so  lots of lemons around at this time of the year once that lot of fruit's gone  that's when you give it a trim. But if  you need to trim it back.

 My lemon tree I think it's Eureka which  uh I I've got y'know lemons uh.

 Seems to have  lemons all year round that's right . But they do have a main fruiting time and that's  their spring time . Then then you have a few lemons hanging around so if your lemon tree's say five or six metres high  what's the use of having a lemon tree that high . You might as well have it  that it's going to um you'd be able to pick the fruit you don't have to get a cherry picker to pick it.

 Uhuh and Sue can I just ask you something else please.

 Certainly.

 Uh at one time you had uh a recipe for fruit fly on uh for citrus trees also  I think it had water ammonia and something else.

 Yeah pretty close you've got water cloudy ammonia vegemite  and sugar that's right and are you connected to the internet.

 No I'm not.

 Okay it's on the internet site if you know someone who's got the internet go to Sue's Garden.

 Go to a library maybe  they'll tell you how to work things.

 Yeah dot com dot A U suesgarden as in one word  and um you'll get the whole recipe.

 Right  and it's good stuff for the fruit flies is it.

 It is good stuff as a attractant to  fruit flies actually Genevieve it's a it's a bait to attract the fruit flies before they cause the damage so you hang it in the tree early in the season.

 Thanks very much Genevieve Norma of Kewdale hello Norma.

 Hi Norma.

 Good morning Harvey good morning Sue. Um.

 Don't speak Dutch Norma by any chance.

 No I don't   double-dutch but not Dutch .

 Yeah that's what I said yeah .

 Um. Uh Adeniums Sue  can I prune that now or is it too late or too early or.

 About  well you can prune it now but I'd be laih waiting till it warms a little bit just a little bit . Ah well  this weather's been fantastic hasn't it it's been really  warm spring weather   but um usually the beginning of spring  is is just the general rule of thumb  yep so that  new growth yeah  very easy to um to to prune to look after so if you just wanna give it a trim up.

 Yeah 'cos it's looking  pretty awful at the moment.

 Yeah yeah do tend to .

 Yeah.

 So ih it's up to you but I'd be waiting a few weeks.

 Yeah I'll  do that.

 Okay.

 Thank you.

 You're very welcome Norma.

 Bye.

 Goodo thank you very much indeed to uh Norma and uh to everybody I wonder if we'll ever give that innuh there's a couple of um  interesting um events coming up have you got them there.

 I have Harvey and we've got a couple of events happening there's our orchid show happening um this weekend actually. It's on at the Newpark shopping centre so the last day today at Girrawheen the Wanneroo Orchid Society will feature beautiful display orchids from many countries incrood cluding  Australia and experienced growers will be available every day to advise on culture 'n' things and I'm sure the good people at the Wanneroo Orchid Society is um  not not phased if you bring a grotty old plant in 'n' say how do I fix this up so they really wanna promote and encourage the participation of growing orchids so they'll be able to help you with any details at the Newpark shopping centre in Girrawheen on today. And Harvey something to put in your calendar if you've got nothing to do in the beginning of August or sorry middle of August the Nannup Flower and Garden Festival  is happening from the thirteenth to the twenty-first of August there's nine days of flowers gardens art the tulips are pushing upwards and will be at their best at that time of the year and a floral display in Nannup's town hall open gardens and a display by the W A Daffodil Society plus a new event called a Gardeners Day Out if you want any more information contact the Nannup visitor centre on nine-seven-five-six-one-two-double-one or W W W dot Nannup W A dot com one word Nannup W A dot com uh put that in diary that'll be just a beautiful day out as well.

 W wonderful. Hello Noelene of Shoalwater chatting away there on the phone.

 Hi Noelene.

  Hi Sue hi Harvey. Uh Sue I've got a Kaffir lime tree in a pot.

 How's it going.

 Uh well I've had it for about three years 'n' it's  it's growing nicely but it's never had a flower or a fruit on it.

  They don't have fruit you don't  have kaf Kaffir limes for the fruit you grow them  for the foliage  so so if you wanted a Kaffir lime for sorry a lime tree for its fruit  go for Tahitian lime  but the Kaffir lime is grown for its pungent brilliant foliage so you just pick a few leaves off 'n' cook with them.

 Yeah I  do.

 And um they are very hesitant in setting fruit that's not unusual.

 But they do have fruit don't they  because on the uh the tag it's got a  picture of a lime on it but.

 Yeah not very many  but they do  they are few and far between so mostly grown for its  for its foliage.

 So not doing anything wrong with this one then.

 Not doing anything if it's looking beautiful keep at it.

 Okay thanks  and the other one Sue  I've got a an eggplant tree.

 Yes.

 In a pot . And  excuse me it it does get fruit on it and they're like little golf balls and they're yellow and  hard and uh y'know they just don't do anything.

 Did you get this eggplant tree as a grafted eggplant  from Sunflower Garden Centre or somewhere like that.

 Ah somewhere in the northern suburbs  my mother gave it to me.

 Yeah. They um there's someone growing them  from there  uh they are grafted onto a root a hardy root stock that  then um will will keep growing beautifully and I think from memory there's prickles on the root stock  and the top should keep growing so  what if they get hard and don't do anything at this time of the year Noelene I wouldn't be worried about that  because of the cold. The what do you feed it with.

 Oh anything that comes to hand.

 Yeah it needs to be lots of food push it on I'm wondering  if it's actually the root stock that's taken over . Because it shouldn't have it should have big purple rooh  beautiful eggplants.

 They start out nice and purple  'n' then then they go yellow.

 Yeah and how big are they . Yeah they will yellow up  they will they will yellow up if they've been on the plant for too long. What I'd do  and just as an experiment let's see how we go is just feed it with PowerFeed liquid fertiliser  'n' just really push it on  and see if that makes a big difference for you.

 What every couple of weeks.

 Yeah definitely. Every couple of weeks.

 Okay.

 Okay.

 Thanks Sue.

 You're welcome t.

 Bye.

 Bye.

 Righto it's right on nine-thirty we'll take a break Susie.



 Twenty-seven minutes to ten goede morgen . Perth that's that's there in uh  very much like the Germanic good mornih g uh no sorry goede goede   G O E D E goede mor goede morgen . That's Dutch for good mornih but our Dutch friends can't get through 'cos everybody else is clagging up the lines wanting to talk to you in English . We worked out what tuin T U I N was you were right . Garden.

 Garden. Garden I wonder what um oh there was another word oh waterwise I wonder if there's such thing as waterwise in 'cos there's so much water  in Holland that they wouldn't have to worry about waterwise . Or what water wouldn't water would mean.

 W A T E R  W I S E  uh .

 I don't think they'd have a drought there would you. Never . What does that translate to question mark.

 Question mark  . Hang on well let's just see what water is. Water.

 So we're having a language leshun as lesson as well.

 Water is god there's a five-hundred-million oh well the first one's good water  .

 I vote I'll use that one .

 'N' the second one is  begieh begiet can you say that sorry.

 Begieten.

 Begieten. B E G I E T begieten. Well what's wise.

 Besprobiesehn  .

 Hang on W I S E.

 Gieten gieten is another one.

 Wise.

 Mm.

 Verstandig.

 So water verstandig .

 Wat so you have a wat you have a vah it'd be vater ver  vater weh v vater verstantig wigg wigg oh gosh.

 You sound German  .

 I vos  never a Nazi . Let's go to Jenny of Leeming. Hello Jenny .

 Oh good morning Harvey good morning Sue.

 Hi Jenny.

 Hi how are you.

  Really well.

 I I'm ringing up uh I've got some lawn and I was wanting to take up some of the lawn for over summer  uh 'cos it churns up so much water . And I was thinking about replacing it if you've got any ideas for some  waterwise gard uh ground cover.

 I have there's lots  uh Jenny is it in full sun.

 Yes.

 One of my fay well there's a few did you want native native ones flat  do you want all the same do you want a um a  substitute that you could then  j uh uh start from the beginning d'you wanna keep it just as a lawn green flat area so it looks like lawn but it's not.

 Yes I was  thinking of doing that.

 Yeah don't wanna put sort of a pathway and native grasses or anything like that  through it. One that's just fantastic is the Myroporum  parvifolium the broad leaf form . It's very flat . And it is um bright green same colour as a bright green lime green lawn and it's a very flat little star white flowers on it Myroporum .

 Yeah how do how do you spell that

 Myro M Y R O.

 M Y R O.

 Porum P O R U M  . Broad leeh broad leaf form.

 Broad leaf.

 Yep. Now uh that's just a fantastic substitute that's getting it is a bit tricky so just  have to go to your l local garden centre 'n' see if they can find it 'n' see see if  we can work from there.

 And wuh  when's the best time to plant it.

 Oh I'd be planting it any time from now Jenny.

 Oh okay.

 This this plant spreads about two metres round it's very flat it's used a lot on road verges 'n' things  particularly up our area where there's just heavy soil and just lawn is not practical so  does very well another plant that works well is one called Hemiandra pungens H E M I A N D R A.

 H E M I N.

 A N D R A.

 A N D R A.

 Yep Hemiandra pungens that's a fantastic um ground cover  and that but that's prickly if you wanna walk on it  you need shoes so.

 So yeah the  other one might be better.

 Um the other one's better uh Lippia is another one that attracts bees the  um that's very tough that's a ground cover used a lot for a lawn substitute  and it has pink flowers once a year and those pink flowers are very attractive to bees so you just mow them off when they flower and.

 Oh right so you can just mow it off.

 Just mow that off  but um the flowers that's a really good one you duh grow that by tubes you can't grow that by seed you need to buy that by pla sorry yeah buy that as plants and plant  the runners . And that'll eventually creep into your lawn too so you need to really separate the area that's tough . Another plant that is a very interesting actually it's not bright green in its foliage but it's a greyey green has flat yellow flowers is a plant called Dimondia D I M O N D I A  that that looks like a really miniature gazania you know the form of the gazania it's really flat ground ground-hugging gazania and  that's a really tough one as well.

 Right okay oh that's.

 That gives you some choices Jenny.

 Yeah lovely  thank you very much for that.

 Good to talk to you.

 Great.

 Bye.

 Bye.

 Okay thank you very much indeed uh to Jenny she was uh very nice and now I what have I done here yeah what she was after was  grondslag beslaan . That's ground cover in Dutch.

 Grondslag beslaan.

 Uh grondslag beslaan.

 Beslaan. I'll remember that not .

 Yeah well it's probably wrong . And the pronunciation's  probably way wrong.

 That's probably why no one's .

 Hello Vicky of Balcatta.

 Oh good morning Sue and Harvey  how are you.

 Fantastic.

 Um my husband wants to put uh an olive tree out the front uh it'll be in full sun and he likes his frut et cetera to be the biggest you can get so  can you suggest  um um olive tree that has um the big fru  big fruit on it.

 And I've got it but the problem is there's one called U C one-five-seven I think it's one-five-seven hybrid  and it has huge fruit  huge like the size of cumquats.

 Oh yeah that's  what he'd like.

 But you need to pick them green and do something with them when they're green  because if you let them go go till they go black they're soft and mushy  so that's what happens with mine.

 Yep yep okay  that's fine yeah.

 Uh that variety has rea what they call really high flesh to pip ratio small pip lots of flesh . Uh you'll find um one of the best ones you can't go past kalamata olives Vicky  the for the flavour  ah and uh look I've got four or five different varieties down the driveway. This U C one-five-seven hybrid meaning University California the U C um is bred from that . Huge fruit but um you need to pick them and eat them and pickle them or process 'em when they're green.

 And the kalamata you don't have to do that obviously .

 No you don't you can have 'em when they're black as well 'n' a nice tree kalamata's probably more a widely available as well.

 Okay and how big does the kalamata one grow.

 Oh you'll be looking with a olive tree you can let them grow up to six metres high . Uh it's no use having fruit that high so  keep it at about four.

 Yep keep  it trimmed yeah  and and the U C one-five-seven  w how the same as that .

 Yeah that's a bushy plant mine would be five metres high now mine needs a trim  uh how it's growing but they're all pretty much the same they can be trimmed really easily that's that um keep him contained I've seen some fantastic olives standardised too . In Italy um on those slopes along Mediterranean coast they pollard them they trim them back hard every year  so they're huge trees  um huge trunks but they've  had their tops trimmed off.

 And sorry just one last question how  do we have to prepare the soil for those.

 Prepare the soil is dig yeah you've got lots of that um acih like that that sand that's on top of those swampy areas  so you need to dig a hole that will be at least sixty centimetres deep by the same wide  discard at least a third of the soil out of the bottom and put um soil improver in it mix that with the existing soil  and yeah the better  even though we say olive trees are tough they don't need much the better preparation you can give them the better the plants do . Yeah.

 Alright Sue  that's fantastic.

 You're welcome.

 Thank you.

 Bye.

 Okey-dokey thank you very much indeed nineteen minutes to ten and uh time for another break.



 Oh dear what a lovely surprise. Let's go to Kelmscott hello Evelyn.

 Hi Harvey how are you.

 Really well thanks.

 Good um I just want to know if anyone in the Kelmscott area do you know of anyone in the Kelmscott area that does fruit tree pruning. We've just moved into this house and  there's about six trees out the back need pruning.

 And it's like where do I start  . Yeah call in to Colour Drop Garden Centre anh  and see if they can help you or they put you onto someone  they've been there for a long time.

 Yeah I kno  I know where they are yeah  also uh a bat plant  d'you uh know anywhere in W A where you can buy bat plants.

 I don't  no.

 They are absolutely beautiful nobody seems to know anything  about them  over here.

 I don't.

 What's a bat plant.

  A bat plant mm.

 W yeah what what is a bat plant.

 Don't know.

 It's oh it's like a  a lily it comes up like a lily type of thing but the b the flower itself looks just like a bat.

 There you go.

 They are absolutely beautiful.

 Tt I'm going to have to chase it up 'n' have a look 'n' find out . Evelyn where did you see them or when.

 In New South Wales  I was over there last year and everywhere you went all the markets 'n' that had these for sale.

 You know what might be the problem. They might be classed as a weed  over here . No over here  and that's the reason why they're not allowed in from  the start so if we know the we'll see if we can find the botanical name and I'll do some research for you.

 But they are absolutely beautiful.

 Okay we'll see  what I can find out.

 Have you got a query ab oh you no you've done  that. Listen now  how would you like to win a forty-five dollar Solvol citrus soap pack for uh for really throwing in a nice curly one this morning Evelyn.

 I would like to win anything .

 Okay  well you've won  one of those. I'll put you onto um grumpy 'n' he'll look after you.

 Alright thank you very much.

 Thanks Evelyn.

 Okay thanks a lot.

 Okay and now Ruth at Gwelup hello Ruth.

 Hello Harvey and Sue how's things.

 Really well.

 Harvey don't tell me you b barrack for the Hawks do you.

 I will tell you that.

  Well I love Shane Crawford so that's okay.

 Yeah oh that's alright then .

 Uh he's pass  he's allowed.

 Now I've got a lucky bamboo in soil and I think I'd like to try 'n' put it into into water 'n' stones if I could . Can I do that.

 Easy all you need to do is grab the sink or grab a bucket fill it up and tip it outta the pot wash all the soil off and away you go  that's all you need to do so simple and then if you've got a vase or some stones that you can put.

 Yes yes.

 Yep yeah no problem that's so easy  I think they actually do better in in water.

 Yeah well I seem to forget to water it a bit and  um.

 They don't like drying out.

 No  and I've got some Aquaplant hydro phonic hydroponic fertiliser.

 Now your hydroponic fertiliser is that high in other nutrients rather than nitrogen.

 Um.

 Tt do you know.

 It's got.

 Have a look at it.

 Nitrate nitrogen two-point-one-one ammonium nitrogen point-two . Total nitrogen two-point-three-one  phos phosphorus  potassium.

 Yeah yep. Those are high. I would be looking at you can use it but it's not ideal lucky bamboos need high nitrogen fertiliser not not um high phosphorus or all those other things so  it's better to use um a fertiliser that's high in nitrogen something like Thrive.

 Good on you Ruth that uh should answer the question now did I do good did I.

 You did so fantastic.

 Did I do good.

 Yes I think I think it's actually classed as  if it's a bat plant you can grow it in tropical areas so it doesn't grow so well here um Evelyn so just looking at some information that's on the internet. Paradise Distributors it's available if you go  under Burke's Backyard website there's a a fact sheet on the white bat plant which is  most  it's commonly known as the white bat plant   so but not seen it available here. There you go.

 Okay.


"
" Program G P Dr Sally Cockburn good morning.

 Morning Neil.

 I thought this would be impossible your doctor  always knows what's wrong.

 Look we don't I mean no one knows everything and I think one of the most important things I've always said is a good doctor is someone who admits their limitations. And uh I I suddenly thought the other day and I thought this might an interesting topic to discuss which is 'cos I received an email from someone actually saying I've been to a whole lot of doctors and they can't find anything to tell me what's wrong with me. And this notion of going from doctor to doctor to doctor does it actually get you anywhere or would you be better to stick with the one doctor who says I don't know but let's use me as a home base and find out what we can learn.

 I think most people would've been through that at some stage  where you go to the doctor you've been crook for ah dunno we've done all the blood tests I dunno. It's a virus go away and uh it's still there a month later.

 Yeah but really if you listen to what they say they're not saying go away. What they're saying is I don't know what's wrong with you at the moment I'm really willing to keep looking and I really want you to come back if you don't get better. People often assume oh they're not interested they don't care  and they don't come .

  I wouldn't say that.

 Yeah but what I'm saying is I think that ih it's more productive to go back to the person who knows what you've already been looking at or what you've been testing for rather than going to another doctor and getting a whole set of  .

   what if I say okay just  uh a bit I'm not happy I wanna go to another doctor  and get get checked over again can I require the doctor who's been treating me to send all my files across.

 Well under the privacy laws these days you've got access to your health records anyway so of course.

 So I can pick them up and take them with me . It wasn't normally the case was it.

 Y y yeah no it has changed I think it was two years ago 'n' 'n' well I launched the the act I think it was two years ago in July.

 Yeah okay so what's your advice. You've been going to the doctor you're going to the doctor you just can't identify what's  wrong but you know something's wrong.

 Well I think to ask the doctor can you give me some sort of plan on where to from here and that is y'know are there other tests I can have or should I g should I g uh can you refer me to a specialist or something and I don't think there's any doctor in this state or in this country or in this world who would not oblige and I think that's the thing if I don't know the answer if I can't help you and you've still got symptoms then it is up to me to either I believe send you off to someone else or keep looking.

 Nine-six-nine-six-twelve-seventy-eight ever been through it they just couldn't decide what was wrong with you. We don't know what's wrong with you you know you're crook so what do you do. And what happened. Nine-six-nine-six-twelve-seventy-eight calls for Dr Sally Cockburn. Nine-six-nine-six-twelve-seventy-eight when the doctor just didn't know what's wrong with you. Tell you what I hate 'n' it's happened to me  once  once or twice. What I hate though is getting on a merry-go-round when the doctor and quite rightly s look I dunno what it is. I can see there's a problem but this is alright that's alright we've done all the tests. We'll have to send you to a specialist  and off you go through that with usually  a physician  specialist physician 'n' ye here I go again more tests  they hang you upside down by the ankles and take blood from your left nostril. Hate it . I'd I s look if I'm gunna get better I'll just let it go away.

 Look I think one of the important things is is that most people are worried have I got cancer or have I got something serious and oftentimes we can rule out that there's something serious going on but we can't give you a name for it so we we play a bit of a watchful waiting game we see what develops and I think that's the important part we're waiting and watching you're under surveillance I.

 So are the serious things usually uh comparably easy to rule out.

 In a lot of cases I can't give a blanket  answer on that but the thing is that usually um y'know 'n' people say oh well just give me a total body M R I and you'll rule everything out well that's not the case either. Um you can't do these blanket tests that rule things out. It's a matter of putting jigsaw pieces together often Neil and it's a combination of your story uh re physical examination and tests.

 What's the key test then what's the first thing you do if I come to you and say I'm absolutely exhausted I can't get myself  up and going  which is the normal thing  what do I say.

   As the first thing I'd.

  it is Thursday so of course I am.

 I go the first thing I'd do is talk to you about um what the options could be and and in fact that happens to me every day in my practice  and uh I say look tiredness is one of the d most difficult things to investigate 'cos it could be very serious or it could be absolutely nothing it could be anything from physical to emotional and we need to start somewhere but we need to stop somewhere too. So I ask the patient what they're concerned about I try to localise any symptoms the classic things you ask about Neil are weight loss weight loss is a um as in that you haven't been trying and it has happened anyway. Um pai localising pain so if you can we try to get a handle on localising where the problem might be and wih there's a thing called Occam's razor in medicine Occam was some great philosopher and he said common things happen commonly and if a symptom uh if there's a set of symptoms try and link them up together rather than thinking of several different things going on.

 Okay and is there a b is there a a b a blood test a generic blood test to do.

 Look there's no generic blood test there's certain uh b like the sorta thing we're looking for with tiredness obviously would be top of the list anaemia  um so we'd do a full blood examination and check your haemoglobin and your iron studies they're quite common especially in women that's a not an uncommon thing. Thyroid is another common cause of tiredness.

 What's your sedimentation rate.

 An E S R an erih erythrocyte sedimentation rate's a great test. It's probably the most vague test known to man I don't really understand why it's significant but this is how it works. You basically put a whole lot of red blood cells in a in a tube and you see how long they take to settle at the bottom. If they take a long time to settle you're sick if they settle quickly you're well.

 But does it say what's wrong with you.

 No. It'll tell you whether there's some sort of inflammatory process going on um the sort of inflammatory processes can range from that you've got a cold through to cancer  so it doesn't mean anything.

 Although don't  . Although well everybody does it.

 It doesn't mean anything specific there .

 I've got blood cells dropping out of the sky all over the place. Diane hello.

 Hi Steve how are you.

 Neil. Who's Steve.

 Oh  .

 Jeez you're outta date.

 .

  I didn't even like him anyway and um.

 Neither does most of Sydney. No that's not fair.

 No that's not.

 He's he's alright he's just at war at the moment unfortunately.

  I'm just ringing about um about six years ago um my husband came home from work never took a day off in his life 'n' we took him to the oh we went to the doctor 'n' he was diagnosed with a virus. Went on for a week um on the Saturday he couldn't stand up I took him to the hospital and he had legionnaire's disease.

 Legionnaire's disease  um thing to diagnose we we actually think it's probably a lot more common in the community than we we believe uh it often gets passed off as the flu when people get over it.

 The sick building syndrome.

 Yeah but uh it's uh ih well I prefer to just cause it a call it a a bug y'know it it is part of the.

 That's what you say all the time. Don't feel well oh you've got a bug it'll go away.

 No look  we don't Neil uh . No w we we say at the best to the best of my ability I think you've got a bug but of course if it goes on or the following symptoms um recur then we need to see you. But what's ac.

 It's not a very satisfying diagnosis for a person  you've got a virus.

 I know.

 Can't treat it.

 But can I a very big point was brought up there. It's very important to say to your doctor I've had these symptoms for five days or whatever I've I've been working on the assumption that it was a bug I'm coming to you because I actually   it is and also I never go to doctors. Give a context of of your state of health.

 A break more calls Dr Sally Cockburn program G P.



 Dr Sally Cockburn program G P we're taking calls what do you do when the doctor doesn't know uh we've also managed to make contact with the uh one of the executives at All Sports Direct the people who are behind this uh  raffle  rort as I called it. Uh they're still not talking. Still not talking. Valerie go ahead.

 Hi Neil  Sally how are you.

 Good.

 Um I was very ill  uh well I'd misdiagnosed by a doctors a while back. Um I think they thought I was a housewife  'n' just sort of thinking about myself at home looking after children um my  kept getting swollen very swollen stomachs and um my husband take me up the doctor's and they end up saying  in the finish. Take her to see a psychiatrist.

 Mhm.

 Anyway uh what happened um couple of weeks later I found another new doctor. And  tests and I had tumours wrapped around my bowel I nearly died . And I was in hospital eight weeks.

 Look I I think Valerie there there's the real problem is it comes down to communication I think often that that what we need to make sure we we have is communication on both sides of the uh of the s the stethoscope. That we need to make sure the doctor is listening when you talk  does take you seriously and that if you feel that you haven't been able to get your story across you need to ask again. I I think today though we're we're m interested in in really the issue of when the doctor says they don't know and you've done the right thing you get a second opinion.

 Do you reckon doctors over rely on uh uh technology at times rather than uh  investigation or in quetio or  questions or  even instinct.

 Yes yes yes yes I do . Yes I think that modern medicine is going that way I believe in the art of medicine. Um certainly there's the gut feeling Neil and the number of times I use gut feeling which is look these tests say this but I gotta tell you I'm feeling this. Okay I can't  it's not scientific. But people want to think um that at least you're thinking and they wanna know you're thinking and that's important.

 I remember when I was misdiagnosed by a machine with  pancreatic cancer years ago and the bloke who ran the  the company that had the machines y'know the doctor in charge of that I saw him after the event and he said I I knew you weren't crook . Uh I looked in your eyes.

 Yeah uh l look you weren't yellow.

 I wish you'd told me.

 Well I think Neil the thing is that we we have these tests I get tests back all the time and there's a recommendation I'm committed to follow through that recommendation because let's face it medih meh medico-legally if I don't I'm in strife but I say to the patient look y'know this seems unr unnecessary my gut feeling is  but I can't stand up on a gut feeling in court.

 Oh of course. Rosa hello.

 Hi.

 Hi Rosa.

 Um I'm just saying that my father's actually in the exact position whereas they couldn't work out  wrong with him so now he's in hospital for three days to get every kinda test possible.

 That's a reasonable option.

 Yeah.

 Can I say one of the other things though when they say oh we don't know what's wrong with you is to do your own reading do your own research have a think don't get sc oh no Neil you're looking shocked  'cos I've said. No I have no problem with people using the internet if they use it wisely and don't m make self diagnoses  but think of options and the other thing I have no problem with it.

 Very wise doctor once said to me they should take all medical advice books and burn them.

 No. Not  medical advice I'm talking about going to.

 Well you know those little Reader's Digest  what is wrong with you . Diagnosis in  two-hundred words.

 You're just looking up information   everyone deserves to be informed.

 Same thing if you're sp ih the average person spends ten minutes on the internet they'll have six different diseases and I put myself in that category. We're all hypochondriacs.

  reputable sites like mine .

 We're all hypochondriacs we'll all be convinced that's what we've got.

 Well then to be honest with the doctor what you're scared of. Y'know the number of people come in  oh I've got this little sore finger here w oh are you worried it's cancer well I am actually but I didn't want to say.

 Rosa how's your dad going. No. Dropped out has she.

 Yes.

 How how's he going.

 I don't know.

 Whadda whadda your s what are his symptoms.

 He's just got um pains in the stomach that is very unusual 'cos he never ever ever gets sick  and they've been going on and off for six weeks and he's had C T scans he's had uh colonoscopy grastroscopy   loads of blood tests so now they're just putting everything through.

 Yeah oh  feel sorry for him going through that  circus.

 But the thing is I mean y y'know sometimes we get tied up in the notion of we need to find a diagnosis and sometimes we can't actually call it anything. Um and if we know it's nothing serious we need to work on how to get better.

 Y'know the other thing is if you don't go to the doctor you don't get sick.

 Hm hm hm hm hm   and w and don't go to hospital 'cos people die there.

 It's  exactly. Barbara hello.

 Um  good morning Neil and good morning Dr Cockburn. Um look I was just wondering what ever happened to the um old family doctor who knew um all your history.

 We're still around.

 And they were marvellous diagnosticians  um when you went to the doctor you had take specimen of urine which they  tested .

 We still do that.

 No we don't.

 Yes we do  we do.

 No you don't.

 I don't.

 We do. I can assure you. I can't tell you how many times I keep running outta the little dippy sticks . Uh I think I I take your point.

 What's the dippy stick that's for uh diabetes.

 Oh all sorts of things diabetes in infection. Can I pric  your point up and I agree with you entirely  that that unfortunately  the way the world is going medico-legally and timewise um uh w that the art of of the family physician is is dying but we still exist and certainly specialist G P training is encouraged.

 Be good to rephrase that I think.

 What did I say.

 The art of the physician is dying.

 The art yes I mean that it's all being taken over by technology.

 Not the aim the okay. Righto.

 The art  the art of  yes the art is disappearing sorry . Um the thing is that we y'know I teach medical students and we are trying to encourage them to remember the importance of history taking and physical examination and to never forget that.

 It is very reassuring to have a family doctor who you who's known for years  and when you ring up and you say I've got a pain in the gut   he says oh you had that last week  or you had that two years ago or you idiot you've been on the red wine again.

 Yeah well look I must say I've I've got patients I've had for fifteen years and I I love seeing them  because I know  .

  .

  And oh even longer actually couple of them. And I n I know it's reassuring for them because they know I know them and uh it's good.

 Dr Sally Cockburn our disease of the week is tiredness. Fix it.

 Yeah I'd love to Neil. G um basically look at your lifestyle before you start looking outside. Stop smoking. Go to bed early. Do all the healthy things. Don't stress at work. And at the end of the day go through a list of things you can change and things you can't change and just wipe those ones off that you can't change and start working on the ones you .

 Do you ever get tired.

 Of course I do.

 Physician heal thyself.

 I go to sleep. Or I veg out with a movie oh go and see um um that Jack Nicholson one. Love it.

 We are talking uh about movies on the Paul Murray show here as we do each and every evening  at about this time talk to a whole bunch of people that have been driving back  from a film that they saw at nine-thirty or maybe were home 'cos they saw one at seven-thirty give us a call one-double-three-nine-six-nine if this applies to you on offer my friends for the best reviewer of the evening is a special D V D release  of a truly classic film. Glen saw the Butterfly Effect in Macquarie Centre mate what'd you think of it.

 That is the best movie I've seen in my life. Seriously I've seen a lotta movies and that that movie like yeah.  Blew my mind it's that good yeah.

 Massive call but why.

 Why.

 Mm.

 Oh it's just full of action and the twists and the turns in it 'n'  and the acting like Ashton Kutcher and the and the other girl that's in it that you haven't even heard of before . See she really plays her part well and I have to say that everyone should go and see it anyone who gives this this movie a bad review should be shot seriously it's a really good movie.

 I think you've just made a proh a poster my friend.  Now tell us okay now is it a thriller is it an action mooh what is it.

 It's everything.

 It's everything.

 It's everything it.

 Is it a porno.

 No .

 Is it a children's movie.

 It can be .

 Is it a cartoon.

 No it's a .

 Is it made by Pixar.  I think I've proven my point but yeah.

 Yeah yeah it's a bit of action I'll yep comedy it's got everything in it it really has.

 And the Paul Murray show where we are fastly running out of time here I think I'll ih can invent words if I want to but we talk about the movies now just heard  from a young gentleman who declared none other than Glen who said that the Butterfly Effect was the best movie he's ever seen and there is no way that anyone who says that it is a bad film in fact he said that anyone who gives it a bad review should be shot. Lara is it time for me to cock the gun.

  No seriously it's crap.

 Why now don't give anything away but why.

 I mean I love Ashton Kutcher I think he's the biggest babe but  like seriously this movie was so below him.

 Oh well thank you so much I look y'know what 'cos I love you. You're not gonna got shot.

 I thought that it was the craziest movie that I have ever seen in my life . I thought it was fantastic.

 Now help us in on your your lingo here crazy because it's impressive crazy because it's weird.

 Uh it's just like I'm on my way home now with a friend and we are both just freaked out by watching that movie.

  Well  thank you so much for calling us I hope that wasn't too much of a freaky experience. Oh dear Nova nine-six-nine the Paul Murray show .

"
" Morning Mark.

 Uh uh good morning John. Um the yeah I've I've been listening to you for thirty-two years and that must make me sound old but  but it doesn't but in all of that time in all of that thirty-two years you've done some pretty tough stories but I don't ever remember anything as bad as this Russian thing. 

 I don't either.

 Where where people go out and and um kill babies and children for for for what they think is a  is a is a just cause  and w and we we call them terrorists  but they don't terrorise me they they revolt me they they just revolt me. Uh th I ju we ju they're cowards. They're most the most gutless bums I've I've ever heard of to  to shoot a shoot a a little kiddie in the m in the back. I mean y you you l look at what makes a coward in Australia a coward in Australia is somebody who gunna king hit you in a pub or waits till you turn around and hits you over the back of the head or s or something. But these these people these people that we call terrorists  they go and tie somebody up wi with their hands behind them in Iraq or something and then chop their head off on on video  and and they and they say that that's that's right. Uh uh they say they're executing they're not executing anybody execution is is something that's done by a court they're they're just murdering cold blood murder.

 That's what it is.

 And th these l little kids have are exactly the same thing as if they were tied up filmed and and had their heads chopped off because these people get some  gratification out of it. We're what're what're we doing John.

 I don't know. I don't know Mark I sat most of the weekend glued to it looking at it seeing too much of the same footage over and over again I've gotta say but nonetheless  it was uh it was just an awful weekend for us but uh I was think about it this morning while I was taking a shower  uh we were worried in Sydney last night because uh there was a hail storm.  Uh we were worried probably 'cos there was a traffic jam.  The hail held up the traffic but the hail was nothing like the hail of bullets  that uh those little kids experienced in the back of their legs back of their little heads  uh beautiful little skin just ripped apart by bullets  and all in the name of uh religion or politics tase take your pick.

 Well th wu you y'know you say religion you've s you've said this many times you say it's not all Muslims. I know but when was the last time you saw or heard a Muslim doing a good brave deed for the whole world community. 

 Well I'd I can't tell you that but of course that would happen because there are many good Muslims. It's just this fanatical  uh branch of uh of Islam that are simply murderers.  And they do it all in the name  of uh of their god and they have this extraordinary belief that they're gunna be off to some wonderful heaven  uh to be able to  rest in peace after the destruction of humanity in the way that they've destroyed it.

 But then we've we blame the political leaders we're blaming Putin now for for for the Russian soldiers not being able to. 

 Well I w   I d  I d I don't know about that I'm not b uh blaming Putin the whole the whole thing was a disaster who in the world could have predicted that such a thing would happen.

 Well why do you need to have your army to have plans drawn up to rescue schoolchildren from schools I mean come on we we we  people aren't meant to take over them.

 Yeah but but in fairness Mark nobody in their right mind nobody in their right mind could have anticipated that that sort of thing would happen  any more than anybody in their right mind could have anticipated September eleven unless you had some uh intelligence on the subject and the same with what occurred  in in Russia. I couldn't ever have imagined in my wildest dreams of any human being wanting to do that to other human beings.



 Well as um  as Mark just said Russian president Vladimir Putin has now admitted the security forces' response was inadequate and ill prepared and promised all sorts as yet unspecified new security measures  but is this uh uh is this part of the international terrorist attack or is this specifically a Russian issue relating to the independence of Chechnya. Clive Williams is an international terrorism expert with the Strategic and Defence Study Centre at the A N U  and he's um on the line Clive good morning. 

 Good morning John.

 Is this specifically about uh Chechnya or is it part of the international terrorist attack on  Christianity.

 Ih it's mainly about Chechnya. The the Russians actually first occupied Chechnya in eighteen-fifty-eight and they've maintained fairly tight control over Chechnya ever since apart from a couple of periods um after the October Revolution in I think it was nineteen-seventeen uh they lost control of Chechnya and it gained some degree of independence and uh uh under Stalin he deported most of the Chechen population to the Soviet far eastern Siberia and they were allowed to return under Krushchev but  y'know there have been periods when Russian control has been relatively weak and other times when it's been stronger but um certainly since probably ninety-four uh they've had trouble controlling Chechnya. And there are some outside elements fighting in Chechnya in support of the Chechens.

 Alright now there the the Chechen independence movement is that uh entirely Muslim.

 Uh I'd I'd I'd say so yes because um I mean it's a predominantly Islamic population there probably are pockets of Christian groups within Chechnya but I think there'd be very small numbers. It's predominantly an Islamic country as is Ingushetia which is a neighbouring  country in Dagestan but um North Ossetia is actually predominantly Christian so it is a bit different to the others.

 Uh di   support from the Christian Chechen population.

 Um maybe uh I I I don't know I mean I s I'd say that if there are Christians in Chechnya they'd be a f in a a very small minority of people there I would think. I don't think uh you know they're a factor in all of this.

 So this ih this is about the independence of Chechnya not about creating an Islamic state.

 Well th th a the aim is create an independent Islamic state so it's two elements there and because of the fact of the population being predominantly Muslim  uh they do get outside support so y'know there has been money flowing in to support the Chechen resistance movement if you want to call it that uh from outside predominantly from the Middle East. But the ih it's by no means a combined  element you know it's misleading to say that that there is a a coordinated ch uh Chechen uh resistance movement because uh some groups are just bandit groups criminal groups uh there are some that are operating under warlords and in fact what happened after uh ninety-six when uh the Russians  basically signed a peace agreement with the Chechens and Maskhadov became president uh one of the things the Russians had promised was to rebuild Chechnya because the infrastructure had been destroyed and uh Maskhadov ended up not being able to control the elements who  engage in criminality because there there basically were no jobs and uh so he lost control and then he was displaced by the Russians who put their own person in. So y'know it's sort of it's a it's been a mixed picture over recent years.

 Now Vladimir Putin has promised tough new measures to deal with this uh problem. If that means sending in the Russian troops again as they did back in nineteen-ninety-nine  w w w what do you think that would achieve.

 Well the the Russians are still the Russian troops are still there I mean it just would mean more sending more troops in. Um I'm not sure that he can actually quash the resistance because you know it's mountainous country and uh and these people I are there for the longer term I mean they can always flee into into surrounding areas too so um I doh I don't think that Putin even with sort of a tough approach can actually resolve a situation  and because of the the number of Chechens that live in Russia itself there's always gunna be a fifth column in Russia that is capable of doing  or supporting activities in Russia anyway so I mean I don't think the the tough approach which he promised previously you might remember  is gunna work I th I think really what it needs is some sort of negotiated agreement  which would involve something like y'know the Marshall plan which rebuilt Europe but rebuilding Chechnya so that people do have alternatives  y'know uh and a vested interest in becoming part of the of a normal economy.

 Do you think that negotiation is a possibility.

 Uh well it would have to be brokered by somebody outside and that's g a difficulty for the Russians because uh Putin would be very reluctant to allow anyone else to come in as an honest broker I think. Uh but I think that's probably the only way it could be resolved because the Chechens don't tru trust the Russians and the Russians don't trust the Chechens so  y'know it's gunna be very difficult to get them to agree on anything without somebody else being involved.

 Okay well uh if Putin wouldn't uh approve of that he's got to approve of something. He's gotta do something.

 Yeah I mean what he's facing I think is more of the same frankly I mean I don't think they'll go for a school again because  uh the people involved this time were heavily criticised uh particularly from the Middle East for doing that. So I think that that was a very bad po uh choice of target I mean apart from the tragedy of it all and so on. Um so I think that they'll probably continue to focus maybe on bombings of trains and subway stations and perhaps aircraft that sort of thing in Russia itself which  they can do with relative impunity.

 Yep. Russia's been accused of being the creator of the Chechen problem itself because of the  the brutal repression it uh perpetrated there years ago and did for did for years the brutality that existed there do you think that that has got uh much to do with what occur uh is occurring now.

 Certainly because um y'know the probably the most committed people are what are called the black widows. And these are uh the widows of of people who have been killed by the Russians or they're women who have been raped by the Russians  um or have had family members killed by the Russians y'know who are quite prepared to suicide themselves in order to kill Russians. And uh y'know that that's gunna be an ongoing problem for them I think that um uh really they're not th I don't think the Russians are really capable of subduing the situation in Chechnya at the present time.

 For the past couple of years since that debacle at the theatre it's been relatively quiet until uh of late with the aeroplanes and the other problems uh they had. Do you think it'll quieten down again for a while or will this cause it to escalate.

 Uh well what we've been seeing in recent times is is a spreading of the problem and a more radicalisation of the problem so  uh it might be that they've y'know they'll they've got limited capability to sustain this kind of level of activity but I think we'll see another resurgence of this kind of activity uh maybe in a year's time or whatever if they're not capable of continuing these sorts of activities for the present time.

 Yeah how powerful is this rebel leader this Shamil Basayev. Is uh would he have condoned the school siege if he'd known about it.

 Uh well they say not I mean the Chechen  were saying this was people from Ingushetia and it was mainly Ingushetia with a few outsiders involved and not Chechens. Now that might be blurring it a bit I mean the Russians are saying of course that it's uh it's international terrorism and and so on. I mean the the truth probably lies somewhere between those two things there probably were some Chechens involved with the uh Ingush fighters that went in there and uh so it's probably a bit more of a mixed picture.

 Yeah uh authorities uh say that ten of the hostage takers were arabs  would that  uh would that indicate an Al Qaeda involvement.

 Uh mm si ih ih in in part yeah I mean it's sort of it's a it's hard to sort of be specific about that because  a lot of these people who are engaged in these sort of conflicts and go to assist whether it be Kosovo or or wherever or Iraq perhaps are basically travelling jihad fighters who look for good causes to fight for a and and go accordingly so  I mean in terms of the numbers I I don't know because I haven't seen from the Russians a a number given of of of arabs say. At the moment the last figure I saw was that they thought there twenty-seven but  um that they that they killed and that there were others maybe that escaped and they don't therefore know  the totality of it all but I'm not sure uh how many uh ultimately were say were arabs but say there were ten. Um that doesn't necessary signify that these were Al Qaeda people they might well uh ha   with Al Qaeda  but simply be ri well they're not really mercenaries 'cos they're not fighting for money but um they they're sort of y'know they have they are fellow travellers in other words.

 Yeah. So where do you think it'll go now Clive what do you think'll happen in the immediate future.

 Uh I think both sides'll probably take stock now. Uh obviously the Russians need to think about how they're gunna improve their C T capability because that's really uh uh shocking I think there  the way that they handled things and they haven't learned the lesson from previous uh situations like you mentioned the theatre and previous sieges of hospitals and so on. Uh they really need to get their act together uh because it seems to be that the Russian military's idea of a successful  situation is where all the hostage takers are killed and y'know  ours would be that the hostages are rescued you know. It seems to be a different a  ap uh perception of how things should should develop and I think they're really gunna have to get their act together  and become more professional in the way that say our S A S is.

 Okay. Clive Williams I appreciate your time very much it was interesting to talk to you and I thank you.

 Thanks John.

 Bye. Clive Williams who's international terrorism expert with the Strategic and Defence Study Centre at the A N U. A very interesting fella and there's the story. They certainly will have some work to do in Russia when it comes to the  security of uh of their people. Uh Putin has made all sorts of uh  verbal promises but uh I suppose it'll take him some time to get  something uh concrete into place sooner the better.



 Debbie what can I do for you.

 Hi John.

 Hi.

 As a mother of three I'm a little bit concerned about this um this dreadful travesty that's happened in Russia.

 Unbelievable.

 I um actually sat down on Saturday night and cried it's just heart wrenching and I I couldn't begin to imagine what they're they're feeling at the moment but the pond scum that did this  deserve to rot in hell they're just the lowest form of of anything.

 Yeah well if you uh if you have faith in that kind of thing you can bet your boots they will be rotting in hell  even as we speak.

 Well it's y'know it's just I I sat down and thought y'know maybe what is the world going to be like in thirty years time when my grandchildren are living. You know.

 Well that's what we've all got to think about.  And that and that's why we've gotta understand that we can't allow this kind of behaviour to go on  that we can't uh accept it as a as a form of life on this planet. It's just uh hideous to think that these people have  a belief that they can do what ever they want for their own ends even if it means destroying the lives of beautiful little children.

 No it's wrong.

 More than wrong it's uh dreadful.

 Absolutely. Well  thanks for that John.

 Okay Debbie.

 Take care.

 And you.

 Bye.

 Bye. I think we all feel the same don't we.



 Thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two our telephone number Peter what can I do for you.

 Yeah how are you John.

 I'm very well what about you.

 Uh good thank you good. Uh mate I was just down having lunch at your establishment a couple of weeks ago . Down there at beautiful Woolloomooloo Bay there.

 Oh were you at Otto.

 Yeah.

 Yeah isn't it nice.

 Oh beautiful spot  beautiful.

 Yeah really .

 Had a lovely time with my girl and I and uh we really enjoyed ourselves.

 Good I'm happy that you did.

 Mate we sat down beside you and my partner was very gobsmacked she couldn't  breath  type thing she didn't know what to say y'know to wish she got a shock that we were even going there. Anyway. Mate what I wanted to ask you you were having a beer  at the time and it was in a had a green label on it I've never seen it before I was just wondering what it was.

 I think it might have been Boag's.

 Boag's was it.

 Yeah.

 Oh okay.

 It coulda been 'cos I tried that a couple of times. I've gotta tell you that I normally drink um  uh Crown Lager.

 Yeah.

 Or if I want a light beer I drink Sterling. But I tried that I think it's called James Boag B O A G is that it.

 Oh okay yeah. I've just ne never seen it before so  I just thought I'd ask you the question .

 Well it was pretty g it was pretty good beer served very cold it was terrific but I like that uh old Crown Lager and if I'm gonna  have a light one that's uh have you tried Sterling.

 Ah yes I have.

 Yeah I think if y if you're gunna have a light beer that's probably the best of all the light beers.

 It's fine.

 Okay and I'm glad  that you went down there Peter and I'm happy you had a good time I'll see you another time down there.

 Good on you mate thank you.

 Okay.

 Okay.

 Bye  bye.



 Two is our telephone number John what can I do for you.

 Good morning John first time speaker man.

 Oh really well that's very nice of you to call.

 Uh I've got a spreadsheet in front of me about all the trouble spots in the world  and the common denominator is Muslim.

 That's true.

 Now are these Muslims following exactly what the Koran is saying about the infidels.

 Yeah well it depends how yes they are w we're the infidels the western world  are the infidels.

 Yes but why don't the straight Muslims or the good Muslims come out and defend that.

 I have no idea. Maybe they're frightened but they don't we say time after time after time  why aren't the good Muslim people and they assure me that there are many and I'm sure I know many. Why aren't they standing in up and uh saying that this behaviour is not acceptable under any circumstances anywhere.

 Uh now these good Muslims they read the same Koran.

 Yeah.

 Uh does the Koran say that the infidel must be searched out and destroyed.

 Yeah.

 It does   I've read it too but I come from the Middle East.

 I see where.

 Uh Malta.

 Okay.

 And you know we're we're told about this when we're four years of age. You know  our .

 Yeah well well that's well John that's called indoctrination and and that's what it is.

 Now I'm I'm I'm a Catholic.

 Yeah I know I.

 I I I I don't care what anybody's beliefs are  as long as they do by their neighbour what they'd have 'em do to them.

 That's right well that's not a bad rule by which to live.

 Yeah but why must can't they come out and explain to us that these people are wrong and disown them.

 Well th it's up to them to do it. I I have to say that a number of Chechens have uh now come out and made it very clear that they didn't  approve but who in the world in their right mind could approve of uh what went on  there in Russia. Who could have uh approved of that but the.

 But the Koran approves it.

 Well that's wuh it would depending uh on the uh depending on the perception you want to take from the Koran the same as it depends  upon the uh impression the interpretation you want to take from the Bible.

 Yes you can not follow  but it nowhere in the Bible does it say you must kill all Anglicans all Presbyterians or Methodists.

 No that's right.

 So.

 But it does in the Koran say the infidels have gotta go. And the greatest infidels according to fanatical Muslims  are the western world us Great Britain.

 So we're in trouble aren't we.

 We you bet we're in trouble.

 .

 You bet we're in trouble and we're in more trouble  because of our n uh neccessary involvement with uh George W Bush  and what went on in Iraq. But I mean we had to be involved there we had to  support George W Bush because we n need the allies. But you're right you said it John. We're in trouble.



 Sydney saw an early start to the storm season yesterday with a couple of hail storms hitting uh a lot of the city of Sydney. There had been forecasts of storms but the the hail was a bit unexpected. On the line is the Manager of the Forecast Office of the Weather Bureau Andrew Trelor Andrew good morning.

 Yeah good morning John.

 What happened.

 Oh look we had us some some very cold conditions go over us yesterday. And it just tended to kick the hail off a bit more than what we'd expected.

 Yeah weh it really did it was really cold and the thing that I found extraordinary was that the hail lay around for a long long while after.

 Yeah that's one of the characteristics of hailstorms outside of the that sort of the main hail season is that you you tend to get lots of little hail and it tends to pile up pretty deep on the ground.

 That's what happened.

 Yeah and rather than in the in the main hail season where you you tend to get bigger hail but there's there's less of it. So  in a way it's y'know about the same amount of mass isn't it but um in in the winter time or the the late um early spring type storms though it tends to lie pretty thick on the ground.

 Yeah it does I don't uh I don't think it would have been damaging hail would it.

 We had some reports of hail um between two and four centimetres in diameter. So that's certainly severe  but um they were they were fairly um fairly widely spaced and I'm don't think there was that much damage apart from the whole clogging up gutters which is what it tends to do.

 That's that's right and then  you get flooding.

 Yeah that's right yeah.

 Are we going to see more of it.

 Well not today um today we're looking fine for hail and um we're just getting into the start of the storm season now so people should be aware that um y'know there the frequency of these storms will increase over the next few months and peaking at about November December that's when we have most of our hail.

 Okay we had last night a second storm coming through I think about half past nine ten o'clock  or somewhere about then. Is that a bit unusual to get a second one so quickly after the first.

 Oh given the the weather setup uh it wasn't. Um we had as I mentioned a lot of cold air coming over us and also a low pressure system in the area and that tends to to aid the storms in their in their development. So it wasn't unusual to get another one um but the the one later at the one in the in the evening was actually the one which had um the largest hail and and and the most severity with it.

 Yeah well I didn't get to see that one 'cos I I was inside I saw the earlier one and it just lay on the terrace  and really as you said it was smaller hail but it just piled up it was like snow.

 Yeah that's right and uh I think some people took advantage of that.

 I think they did too.

 Yeah.

 Okay so so no storms in the near future.

 No um not at least for today or in into the next couple of days but there is some rain on the way  um for Sydney um perhaps tomorrow and into Wednesday. So um people should pr hopefully be um b grateful of that.

 Yeah oh well we need to be grateful for anything we get given the situation.

 Yeah that's right.

 Thank you Andrew good to talk to you.

 Okay pleasure John.

 Bye.





 You need them. Are you there Muriel.

 Yes John good morning.

 Morning.

 Um I still have hail all over my back yard.

 Is that right.

 Yes and the front a little bit of it's starting to melt across the road it's melted  but the sun's just swinging around to the front of my house  and uh I've still got hail all over the front.

 Wow.

 But it was a dreadful storm we had it at nine o'clock last night  and the hail came down for a quarter of an hour.

 Yeah well the early one the the hail was pretty continuous too did it do any damage Muriel.

 No I've had a look around I y'know I'm terribly frightened of n uh the glass you can replace it's the roof I worry about more.

 Y oh yeah sure.

 More than anything you know.

 Yeah but it didn't damage the roof.

 No it didn't damage it the only my son has a lot of fruit trees down the back and it did belt them around a bit y'know his lemons and oranges and grapefruit and his apples and so forth.

 Yeah well I think he'll get over that alright.

 Oh he's not worried about that he said as long as the house is okay.

 Yeah well he's very nice boy. Okay Muriel nice to talk to you and thank you that's uh you're at Merrylands and there's still hail lying around there.



 Okay Julie.

 Morning John how are you love.

 Pretty good thank you.

 I've still got me hail in Mascot here broke me gazebo but .

 Oh did it really was it that heavy.

 Yes it was it's out here in a big bucket now so yeah.

 Okay  and broke your gazebo is the uh top of the gazebo glass or.

 No it's just y'know one of them material ones it's el cheapo .

 Yeah well it's a  el holo now.

 Mm holey it is .

 Okay so that's  at Mascot and there's st and there's still some uh hail hanging around.

 Yeah it's still out here I c can looh I'm looking at it now so yeah. The dog doesn't know what to do with it but he's fine .

  .

 Alright love can I say cheerio to me mum.

 Course you can.

 She's in Maryborough in hi Barb hi Harry  . Thanks love.

  Okay Julie.



  Julie.



 Thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two if you'd like to talk to us uh Glen.

 How you going.

 Very well thank you.

 And uh how're things up there.

 Very good thank you. But what  can I do for you.

 No I was just listening to the radio a while ago when they were talking about uh the problem in Chechnya and  a lady was making comment about  uh good Muslims making a stand against people who are causing the problems.

 Yeah.

 But uh you've gotta remember in the crusade days it was the uh Christians who went down into the Islamic area and tried to convert all them into uh into the Christian faith.

 That's right. They're getting their own back now aren't they.

 It really wasn't uh ih well they weren't doing any trouble until someone come along and started butchering them.

 Yeah well the wheel goes round. But  buh  but we but we can't uh we can't be too concerned about  what happened then in the crusades because we can't do anything about it . But we can be con  we can be concerned about what's going on now because we can do something about it.

 Well that's right the way it is now everyone's gotta get along everyone's gotta be truthful with each other and try and make amends with what's happened before.

 Yeah it's unlikely to happen.

 Well you hope it does.

 You hope it does and you hope it can be done peaceably whether that's  uh possible or not I can't tell you.

 I've got uh uh relatives who are Islamic faith and couldn't find nicer people.

 Yep well that's  quite o quite often the case and that's what we say constantly  uh you can't uh you can't paint everybody with the same brush you can't tar everybody with the same brush because  a lot of people who subscribe to the Islamic faith are perfectly good people.

 Well that's the other thing when they whene whenever you hear them mentioned they always say Islamic or Muslim terrorists  it shouldn't say that they're just terrorists. Because you've got terrorists in every religion if you want to  use the religion as a point of view.

 No no Glen.

 Yes.

 You just have a look.

 Yes.

 Certainly every person of the Islamic faith is not a terrorist  but almost without exception  every terrorist is of the Islamic faith.

 What about Northern Ireland where the northern .

 I said almost without exception.

 Okay.  I know what you mean.

 Yeah and sad  and sadly it's true Glen it's uh it is true.

 

 Okay Lee-Anne.

 Hi John. Um I'm ringing up um w um I'm a I'm a Greens supporter.

 I see.

 Um it's I'm very surprised that in these times of all the turmoil and that that's going on that everybody isn't a Greens supporter.

 I see. Why do you support the Greens what do you think they're gunna do.

 Well they support life  basically that's people that is the people like we've got.

 Doh d don't you think that that.

 We need help in our education we need help in our hospitals our medical our dental  we that's life.

 Yeah what's what's the Greens' policy on health.

 Well they haven't really had a chance. That like they don't have the backing they don't have the knowledge they haven't got the basic like the funding the ability to have  like much knowledge in anything at the moment.

 No well well I know but what what would happen if they had power in the Senate and they could do things  what do you think they might do about health.

 Well I'm sure that they wouldn't be harming anybody like the basic policy of it is life is love.

 Yeah do you  well well that's all of that's that's pretty good Lee-Anne but tell me this do you think uh ecstasy's good.

 Of course it's not good that's an artificial that's not life.

 Okay well why then would the Greens want to have it sold over the counter.

 I don't think I think that's propaganda that.

 It's not propaganda you can go to their website and have a look you'll find it there.

 Oh I  I'm very sceptical about that.

 Well sweetheart it's there W W W dot Greens dot org dot A U and you'll find it.

 I d oh yeah I'm still very sceptical like there is a lot of things that are said about the Liberals and the Labors that's  not true.

 D buh that's right but I'm talking about their policy on their website. Would you like to be riding a bike  instead of driving in a car.

 I don't I don't see the relevance.

 Well that's something else the Greens would like to do they'd like to get you outta your car and onto a push bike.

 I don't think so.

 Well sweetheart you get.

 They they don't want war they don't want turmoil  they're not going to .

 Could could you name wuh could you name  for me Lee-Anne   name wuh name for me one person who wants war.

 Well I well we we all know that we've made mistakes the country has made mistakes.

 I know but who but who wants war.

 Well hopefully ain't nobody.

 That's right so why is anybody else any different to the Greens.  I mean if you if you think all this is a lotta hogwash just go to their the Greens' website and have a look. Would you do you think it's a good idea that Medicare should pay for sex change operations.

 Oh no I don't think all this propagat .

 Okay well the Greens think uh that Medicare should pay for sex change operations.  Do you agree do you agree with same sex marriages.

 I don't think that it's relevant any of that like the v.

 Well it's r  well well well listen now listen l  uh Lee-Anne it's it's relevant if these people.

 'Cos really is Labor or Liberal are they talking about these policies.

 No g.

 No.

 The g the Greens are. It's the Greens' policy. And they're recommending ecstasy and other illegal drugs be sold over the counter.

 Oh but will it ever get it would never get passed.

 Well why but  why should we but but why should we even take the uh take the risk. I mean you're planning to give them your vote which is a hugely valuable thing a hugely valuable thing  and you're gunna give them your vote  shouldn't you be  across their ideas. What about higher taxes wouldn't worry you too much no. .

 Well like I've had I've had my neighbour my neighbour was admitted five times  through like by a ambulance and and released the next day. Two weeks later he died.  This is our medical system  I'd rather have my neighbour alive and well and happy.

 Okay and do you believe if the Greens had power in the Senate that your neighbour would be alive.

 Yes I do.

 You really do.

 Yes I do.

 Well you're stupid.

 Well I don't think I am I think that they  alive.

 You are stupid you are stupid I'm sorry you are stupid.  You are talking about voting for the Greens you have no idea what they stand for   they want to get outta your motor cars and put you on a bike  but thuh they uh do you enjoy a good steak every now and again.

 I do.

 Yeah okay well the Greens would prefer that you were a vegetarian.

 I don't think so .

 I'm telling you what it.

 You're going to the extreme you don't  even know the party.

 I am telling you what is on the website.

 Ah well  that's a lot of hogwash I think.

 Well I agree with you it's a lotta hogwash but it's what they believe.

 I don't think so.

 Listen I know a lot more.

 I I know a lot of Green supporters that do not  believe  that garbage.

 Well they're all stupid too.

 Well  there's no use somebody ringing up and supporting the Greens if you're gunna treat 'em like th you are now.

 W wuh wuh I'm I'm not I'm not  being rude to you  I'm just telling I'm telling you the truth.

 Well I don't believe your .

 I know m I know more about the I know more about the Greens' policies than you do and you intend to vote for them.

 Well it's obvious you're a Liberal supporter and I'm gunna hang up.

 Why why uh no why is it obvious I'm a Liberal supporter.  What the hell's that got to do.

 You don't wanna hear that why  you don't wanna vote for life if you sit there and say that.

 Who said who said I don't want to vote for life it's the most treasured thing that we that we have.

 Hopefully it is.

 Yeah well and and it is but but you've you've got it wrong about the Greens. I'm sure you're well intentioned I'm sure  you really think that a vote for the Greens is really gunna help  Australia well I'm telling you  that it's not gunna change a thing. They won't have the power to do anything about th the death of your next door neighbour  but they m might have the power to encourage people to have same sex marriages and to have ecstasy sold over the counter to kids your kids maybe. You got any kids.

 I don't believe it. It's like saying well if we vote  if we vote Liberal we're for sure we're gunna buy more arms  and go to war.  It's like y'know .

 I I d I don't believe that's I don't believe that's part of the Liberal agenda but.

 Well I for sure.

 But what but what I'm saying.

 Lot of people believe it is part  of the Liberal agenda.

 Well a lot of people believe incorrectly and you believe  you believe.

 You you're telling me I believe incorrectly well that's  life.

 Well you do believe incorrectly .

  Sorry John I've gotta go .

 Yeah okay sweetheart well I'm sorry I mean I'm not meaning to be rude to you I'm simply telling you the truth you're stupid.



 Yeah who was in power during the first Gulf War Lee-Anne my dear it wasn't Liberal was it. It was Labor. Nobody likes war  but I can't believe that people are going to say blindly yeah I'm gunna vote for the Greens because they're pro life pro life of what pro their own damn life. They don't care much about the lives of children if they're talking about  uh ecstasy and other illegal drugs being sold over the counter to young people. G g say heroin and marijuana they'd like that to be sold as well. Now you go and have a look at their website  all you people that's worth doing I'm certainly not telling  telling you what to vote and you d have no idea in the world what I vote I'm simply telling you  to be warned.



 Ker  good morning.

 Uh yeah is it me Khaar.

 Well if that's your name.

 Oh yeah yeah but thanks John.

 Okay.

 Uh first time caller.

 Yeah.

 Uh I like your show recently converted a few months ago from two G B.

 Good.

 Um I don't agree with all the things that you uh say but you know on the whole I I I I find that you try to be objective.

 I do.

 It was good that you brought this guy on who gave a dispassionate view of the events in in Chechnya and the historical background  and all that. Uh that so that was good and I expect that sort of thing and people generally would expect that  uh but straight after that you launched into a gross distortion of uh the uh uh uh uh teachings of the Koran. One of the oft quoted phrases in the Koran is  which means ih literally you go your way let me go mine you can have your own faith let me have mine that was when y'know the Muslims were being persecuted and then when they've they victorious you know.

 Yeah well that's that's really nice say it again you go you go your way let me go mine.

 Exactly and it's a very oft quoted su phrase in in in in in the Koran .

 And it's very nice.

 No-one seems to mention that but you said the the Koran says that .

 But but no hang on just before we get away from this Ker  uh I hope I'm pronouncing your name correctly am I.

 Khaar yeah.

 Khaar.

 Yep.

 Okay uh b uh uh bl you go your way you go mine th all of that's  okay all all of that's very good. So why doesn't uh the fanatical Muslim let the Christian go his way  instead of instead of wanting to kill him.

 Oh well there are fundamentalists say in ever religion then there are people who distort the teachings.

 Yeah well that's what I said.

 And and and and and and and there are uh you know and 'n' there are extra and there is a big debate going on in  in the Islamic world we may be y'know where where uh maybe you're not aware of that  and and   how how how best how best to uh counter this on the wuh on the one hand we don't w want to fall into the laps of those who are you know uh those we have declared to be sworn enemies of Islam on the other hand we want don't want you to think that really play into their hands like in you know like killing innocent people and that sort of thing.

 No terrible.

 But now look go back to where what I was try uh uh alluding to y'know this the the Koran doesn't say that the infidels have to be destroyed  because the Koran gives everyone the right to have their opinion  and that was the basis on which the Prophet fought and won so I think when you said I I cuh I could understand if you it w if ih if it was an honest ignorance but you said as if you knew as if you .

 Well now well well now now Khaar wuh uh just hang on a minute. I mean the Koran you're talking about uh is being interpreted correctly by somebody with an understanding you're very articulate you speak very good English  and you use all the correct words uh and what you're referring to is a Koran that is unknown to people who are fanatical they you read it the right way they read it the wrong way all this business about you go your way I'll go mine  stuff  if if that's the case why don't  the fanatical Muslims  let let the infidels go their way.

 I'll I'll I'll tell where because the the the the misrepresentation might occur from. The the Koran does say that if the infidels attacks you with a view to impose their beliefs and opinions on you you have a right to destroy them.

 That's right.

 So maybe they are trying to interpret that because you know ih is the fact that you know there are things going on where where where you know Muslims and Muslim countries are being ye you know ih ih 'n' you know things that are happening and you may have your views about that uh that to Muslims don't appear to be and you'll find that ina unanimous amongst Muslims that  ninety-nine percent whether they are living in the United States or wherever they they are completely opposed to what the United States are doing a and and and and and so maybe some of this ha uh comes from that uh you know and the .

 That does but but in in fairness to me and you've gotta be fair to me  when I when when I talk about Muslims I say the majority of them are terrific people and they probably do r read the Koran as its meant to be read and they practice peace but ye its very difficult to say that that Islam is a is a religion of peace when you look what's going on what just what just happened in Russia for God's sake.

 Yeah but but again that's a distortion because nothing the I think that guy that you brought on uh that spoke about the background of Chechnya I mean I I think he did a very good job.   the background has n n nothing to do with religion. Its uh the Chechens never liked Russia they were never they uh.

 Yeah I   I I I know I know that I I can't talk for too long I I know what you're saying there but it is to do with religion because the people who committed that frightful crime against humanity  were Muslims.

 Well well they were born Muslims but they they didn't have they didn't say they were doing it for Islam they just happened to be Muslims like you see all these countries .

 Okay so they happened to be Muslims but what they did wasn't too good was it.

 No no no definitely not. I you know I I would support a y'know I would support any action they take to liberate their country a a and there is a lot of hypocrisy going on about that in Palestine in Iraq and many other places uh but y'know to target uh children I know you know a lot of these young see you know women actually do those whose brothers and husbands  have been killed.

 But but let let me say this to you that the theatre  drama that took place two years ago in Russia when a hundred and twenty-nine people  died.

 That was wrong too yeah I don't .

 That w that was wrong too but again that was Muslims that was extreme Muslims.  So why why almost without exception wherever we look where terrorism is perpetrated it is perpetrated by extremists  of the Islamic faith.

 Y y you're trying to identify the uh people and not the action you see the thing that they they did the wrong thing y'know they may be born Muslim or Christian I don't care they did the wrong thing  I do support their desire to become independent and the struggle for that.

 If that was uh  if that if that's the real desire yeah.

 Yeah yeah but you know I I can an I can understand uh h why why they're feeling so desperate I can I can understand that too .

 But you can't take the lives of children just  because you're feeling desperate.

 You can't but but you know it's it's a vicious cycle no one is talking about what the Russians did in Chechnya.

 No. 

 The whole place has been destroyed it's been.

 Well well.

 Just look at a picture of Grozny.

 Oh okay  well the man that I talked to this morning in fact did talk about what the the Russians have done uh to the Chechens  uh and said that the women called the black widows respond on their behalf because they've been raped or family have been killed so so we are made a bit uh aware of that but we can't alter the fact that this it you want to believe that it's not based on religion that's fine but I  I do know that the Muslims are looking for an independent state  in Chechnya.

 Well they're they're looking for a state and some are arguing that re it's it it needs to be a religious one and others are the Chechnyans are they hold their faith very dearly  you know it's up to them really .

 Yeah well it well it is up to them but why were all the people who involved   with this Muslim.

 As a matter of fact though there there's very small Christian and other minorities they do also support this movement they are very insignificant but they also go along with this uh idea of independence they never liked .

 The independence for Chechnya but not independence uh for a for a free independent Muslim state. I've gotta g I've gotta go Khaar I'm not uh cutting you short I've given you a lotta time and I appreciated talking to you and I thank you for your  rational approach to it we just uh differ a little bit on uh  who the infidels are or how they should be treated but you said in there that uh  the the law of Islam allowed if people were forcing you to believe in some other faith you had the right to retaliate. I haven't noticed the Americans trying to force uh the Islamic race to believe in any other faith have you.



 His name incidentally was spelt K H double A R pronounced keeya. And uh he was a nice fellow and very good command of the English language. Jill good morning.

 Good morning John how are you.

 Very well thanks.

 Look I'm hoping you can help me I was reading the Sun Herald yesterday and in their last word uh on the back page  there is an article s about the bad blood between John Coates and Dawn Fraser.

 Yeah.

 And it states in here that Coates does not want any of our young girl swimmers especially Jodie Henry to be associated with Fraser now or in the future.

 Does it give a reason.

 It says Coates is still fuming about Fraser's views on him before the games. But I mean y'know come on let's get real here we're talking about Dawn Fraser.

 That's right yeah  . That's r that well you've said it very well yeah we're we are toh but even if we weren't talking about Dawn Fraser wouldn't matter much who we were talking about uh the point is that you can't instruct people to whom they should speak.

 That's tr .

 I mean I c I can't tell you listen I happen to know your neighbour and I don't like the bastard don't you speak to him again.

 That's right. 

 You'd laugh at me.

 I mean I was just wondering John is it right or is it . 

 I don't know I'll I'll have to have a look at it.

 Yeah it's on the uh it's on what they class as the last word. And it comes down there's a thing it's a rather funny um headline animal magnetism  and it's talking about Jana Pittman and then the next thing it says the bad blood between John Coates and Dawn Fraser appears to be getting worse.

 Yeah well I've I've gotta tell you I really don't know why.

 No neither do I.

 I really don't know why. And I can't remember precisely what Dawn  had to say.

 No I know I know there was a big outcry about her not going being invited over there.

 Yeah.

 Um so whether she came out and said something about that I've .

 I know she know she was a only the only criticism I remember from her was she was critical about  being snubbed  uh by the AOC but they claimed she hadn't been uh snubbed at all she'd been offered all the attention she'd need when she got there. Now maybe the whole thing is a a misunderstanding. But misunderstanding or not misunderstanding  as you said we're talking about Dawn Fraser. If she  so she misunderstood so what  she's still Dawn Fraser.

 That's right well we went to the Olympic trials my daughter and I  we were there the night that young Libby Lenton broke the hundred metre record  and the first person down on that pool deck to congratulate her was Dawn Fraser. 

 Yeah wuh that's Dawney.

 That's right y'know  I mean y'know and these girls look up to her.

 Yeah let me see if we we can get some more detail ih it's not a very uh it's not a very uh detailed sort of  piece is it.

 No it's only like y'know a a spot they class as their last word so I mean it's only a um like a paragraph on it. But it just sort of stood out and I thought now what's going on here.

 Yeah and where wuh when you say it is Dawn you've gotta remember  until Jodie Henry came along the last Australian to win a hundred metre Olympic gold medal was Dawn Fraser.

 That's exactly right.

 Yeah  okay good to talk to you Jill  I understand exactly what you're saying.

 Okay thanks John.

 Alright.

 Bye.

 Bye.



 Well Jan you waited a while there didn't you.

 Good morning John it was worth it I was so hot under the collar when I rang you then you did that lovely interview with that lovely lady.

 Yeah love her  she's great.

 Calmed my blood pressure down about ten points.

 Good what were you angry about.

 Well first of all I'll I'll just thank you for taking that call on the Greens. I hope that you continue to take every call you can get because these people sitting on the fence that are saying oh I'll just give the Greens my vote  they need to know what sorta people vote for them and they need to know their policies and if you keep doing that I'm sure you'll enlighten a lotta people.

 Yeah well it's pretty important to understand a  a pa a party's policies.

 My word John and half the people that you talk to talking to the Greens they don't know a policy.

 We s and that's why I call them watermelons 'cos they're Green on the outside  but they're let me tell you red on the inside they're they have got some very strange views.

 Right what I did ring you about John I just wanted to vent a little bit about the press and I'm sure you'll agree with me on this  uh the things that are coming out in the press to do with the election and everything uh it's annoying me how stupid they must ti think people are. I mean my dad v was a very wise man and I you'd agree with this I'm sure for what you've copped  but he always told me to cut everything in half that you read in the paper and believe a quarter of it.   And you might get somewhere near the truth. John just an example for weeks we had this Mark Latham was gunna give free books to s children. And at the tax payer's expense. Never once did I see it written or heard it reported on Australia has free books we have one of the best public library systems in the world.

 We do you're right.

 Paid for by the public's purse. John schools have fabulous libraries where those children can bring home a book  if a mum and dad wants to read a book to a child they're there at any time to read. And ih y'know I mean another thing with the P M saying that he will he might not be there in three years  John can you tell me that any leader of any party can guarantee that their party will not change through these .

 Course they ca course they can't.

 Mark Latham could get in and do something stupid and open that big mouth of his again and the Labor party could vote him out in a couple of months John.

 It could happen.

 There's no guarantee.

 Uh no guarantee of anything.

 Yeah and my dad always said to me John a P M is only as good as his treasurer and my I'm a big John Howard fan but my only fear would be  ih if Peter Costello became prime minister who'd take his place 'cos he's the best treasurer we've ever had and I don't see why anyone's got anything against than man I don't think he's put a food wrong.

 Uh who Peter Costello.

 Yeah.

 No neither do I I think he's terrific.

 I mean I don't understand it John I don't watch the serials I tune in on Fox for the to the to the parliament. And John that man he is so astute and so clever I just don't know who ever wih is it the press that's got this thing hanging over his head or what I don't understand that.

 Well I don't know either  but uh.

 The nice man  and he's a strong man.

 Oh I think he's terrific.

 So do I and that's my only I would be afraid if John Howard did get put out who'd take t um Peter Costello's place and my other point that I'd like people to think about is absolute power corrupts absolutely and we have every state in Australia Labor and if we had our federal government Labor we might as well all walk to the front door and open up the door and say come on in unions back to the odds and evens petrol day bus strikes standing at a bus strike .

  Yeah Jan I've let you go too long .

 That's oh .

 Thank you very much  for the call.

 Good bye-bye.

 Bye.  Ah corruption absolute power corrupts absolutely. Um vodka corrupts absolutely.



 Well Pat O'Shane has had uh one of her more controversial decisions overruled by the New South Wales  attorney general Bob Debus. She ruled that four men did not have to be tried for attacking a five week old baby. Because they didn't know the baby was hidden inside her father's jacket when they allegedly attacked him in Maroubra last year. But now the attorney general says an ex officio indictment will be issued and the men will be charged with the attack in which the baby suffered brain injuries and a fractured skull. And they could face up to seven years of jail  if convicted. Now uh you can't comment  except to say  why Pat O'Shane  why.



 Morning Shirley.

 Good morning John.

 How are you.

 Oh I've had arthritis in my hands for a month but I don't wanna talk about that.

 OOh that's no good I'm sorry to hear it what can I do for you.

 Oh no it's rotten.

 Yeah it's not good.

 I just rang to say you made my day.

 Why.

 Isn't that K D Lang wonderful.

 I love her.

 And what about that song Crying.

 Yeah I know it breaks your heart . I said to her not only did she  inherit the song she improved it it uh it and that's hard to do when somebody like Roy sung it. But it's beautiful.

 Absolutely  wonderful I d'y'know I can't sing a note. Uh but I love music I love sport I love everything. I live in a home for the aged and they're all too bloody old . And they don't listen or do anything . And I thought oh you were away for two weeks holiday and I thought oh damn.  So it just reminded me when I heard her sing that song I must get me Johnny Farnham tape out the last time.

 Yeah there's some good stuff on that too.

 Yeah every time I get depressed I bring it out 'n' I forgotten all about it. But she was wonderful.

 Yes she is wonderful and uh Shirley I thank you very much for the call and it's good that you listen  and uh love music it doesn't matter whether you can sing or not just love it 'n' listen to the words and that song Crying is I agree just one of the great song. Joe uh.



 Kate good morning.

 Good morning John how are you.

 Very well thank you.

 I like to reply to that lady that you were speaking to earlier in regards to the Greens. Um if she has a look on their website  it might be a bit of an eye opener for her in regards  to their policies.

 Wuh well I've asked her she hasn't looked and I doubt very much that she'd know how to work the internet.

 Well if she if she can 'n' if she does um if she could have a look at paragraph y under their policy section paragraph three-two-one and three-two-f-four and three-two uh five it's very contradicting it contradicts itself so  so profoundly it's unbelievable buh ih I I can't even understand how it's eh well they would even put it .

 Uh hang on just give me those paragraph numbers again  this is a this is after their policies are laid out.

 Yeah. 

 Then paragraphs three-two.

 One. 

 One. 

 Three-two-three.

 Three-two-three and three-two-five.

 Yeah um it says there that the penalties for illicit drugs okay it says you can't use um dr illicit drugs if you're a user under under the practices of um in regards to druh um court cases and w and what have you  but if they want to supply um the drugs I mean what sort of an excuse would that leave open to people who are.

 Well look sweetheart it's just one of a bunch of crazy things that are on that website 'n' the more people that go and look at it the better. We'll find uh uh three-three-one three-three-four and three-three-five and uh and have a look at them for you Kate we'll have a close look and see if we can work out  what it is you're having a little difficulty understandably there. But we'll have a look at it for you. Thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two is our telephone number uh watermelon supporter this is regards Peter to the Green voter who's been led up the garden path to vote for the fairies talk about propaganda the Greens are the experts if you're worried about hospitals after the Greens bankrupt society you'll be lucky to find  a doctor the Greens are actually anti life and go against the laws of nature. Wake up these fools  they aren't what they claim to be thank you for keeping the dream alive regards Peter. Good on you Peter. Well they certainly aren't uh what they want to appear to be we would be I think  quite correct in suggesting that. Thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two Catherine good morning.

 Hi John how are you. 

 Very well thank you.

 Um look I'm just ringing because um I'm not a Greens supporter but what I have done in the past and um listening to your show is what I'll reconsider doing. Is that I'll I voted for one of the main parties either Liberal or Labor  and then you give your preferences . And you hand them over to a Greens without thinking much because you think well they're for the environment. So you give away your preference and 'cos y you know lotta people really don't think about preferences that much but they do count. Um. 

 Well they of course they  of course they count.

 Yes and I just sort of listening to your show I've never really thought about the Greens um much and I'm quite sure there's plenty of your listeners out there'd be like me. Quite ignorant to their um their policies and such you just sort of view them as  well the Greens who are for the environment don't you.

 Well that's what they want you to think but uh there's a lot more to it than that believe me.

 Well I've sorta been a bit shocked by sort of going back to the have to have a look at their website and see what you're talking about because um there certainly isn't many of their policies that I would agree to and having young children I  definitely wouldn't agree to their policy of um handing out drugs such as uh ecstas ecstasy  I'm bit  nervous John .

 No no you  you're you're alright don't you worry about it Katherine I understand what you're saying  and I imagine it's quite true. A lot of people have simply been giving uh preference votes to the Greens 'cos you think oh well they're pretty safe they're gonna save the trees at least. Uh but you don't know what's behind all this. And what  and what's behind it to my way of thinking is very sinister. Very.

 Well I sort of have been quite shocked and um driving around as I say I drive around in my Toyota land cruiser which are sponsors of yours John.

 Thank you darling.

 Doing my job.

 Thank you.

 And um listening to you and I've just actually got quite a shock and I I think a lotta people out there are like myself. Um I'm not really politically minded a lot I sort of listen to everything I'm bit of a swinging voter so I sort of look and think well that main group is the ones that suit me and go with those and you give away your preferences and now  my understanding is that preferences do add up they can I'll actually get somebody in.

 Oh well they can.

 And uh that uh you know you could get a Green in without realising it.

 Okay but Katherine what you've gotta remember  is that n nobody you in particular because I'm talking to you uh has follow any party's how to vote card. You should give your own preferences and not just slavishly follow some card that is given to you by some political party. You must choose your own preferences the way you want to. I mean you can vote Labor and give the preferences to Liberal or the other way round you don't have to give them to uh an alternate party. And you can give them to whomever you choose.

 Well that's true but as I say you if uh what you're brought out now about them um a lotta people like myself have just viewed them as I suppose a harmless um  party um  you know you you interested in the environment I'm in rural Australia I'm interested in the environment um we're on the land  I know a lotta people don't think farmers are interested in the environment um but we are very much so and  and um you you j just basically you think well you're doing the right thing you're giving it to the party you want give it to somebody that's actually for the environment that are trying to do say good for the country as well but you know preferences I think we your listeners out there like myself might actually um you may not change the ones that have uh are gonna vote for the Greens.

 No well that well.

 But if you can get people like myself who haven't actually thought about it um thinking about the Greens and what their policies and having a look at them um you know they're not gonna get the preferences and maybe actually might stop a few of them getting in .

 Yeah  okay.

  don't think will hurt .

 Thanks Katherine.  Thanks.

 Not a worry. 

 Thanks  okay.

  take my call.

 Thank you  thank you uh sweet sweet woman with a nice giggle. Uh they use the the environment thing as their entree card that's how they get in the front door. And then when they're in there look out is it Gerrard.



 uh s she plays. This is silver ribbon week an annual campaign to increase awareness about ovarian cancer. The ovarian cancer research foundation is having to raise half a million dollars to help develop a test to detect the cancer early and one of its major supporters is Raelene Boyle who knows all about sadly ovarian cancer firsthand  and she's on the line Raelene good morning.

 Morning John how are you.

 I'm pretty good how are you.

 I'm very well actually I'm suffering a bit of jet lag still from coming back from Athens but I'm very well.

 How about Athens was that good or what.

 Yeah it was fantastic it was um I didn't think that they could pull it together but they did in the end.

 Yeah well they did but that's what the Greeks are like it's it's never ready until the last moment and when it is ready it's great.

 Well that's what the Australian Greeks kept saying didn't they on television don't worry they'll get it ready well they did.

 Yeah and that's uh that's the way with the Greeks. Uh Raelene you were diagnosed with ovarian cancer when wuh when was that.

 About six weeks before the Olympics in two-thousand. And uh it was a pretty awful time in my life probably the worst time I've ever had.

 I can imagine that it would be. C can you tell us uh wh what the symptoms are. 

 Well there are no real symptoms that anyone can um  describe that will suit ever woman y'know there's some women can have distended tummies some some women can have a diarrhoea .

 Yeah Raelene I'm losing you uh on that telephone we'll  have to try and get Raelene back. Not a great idea to use mobiles if we can  get a solid line because they can  disappear as that one has I want to talk to her about it too she's terrific woman Raelene Boyle. Really terrific and a a great athlete been diagnosed with ovarian cancer but we'll see if we can get her  back on a better line for your sake  uh bad news from the Northern Territory this morning police have confirmed the man who died in a shooting incident yesterday  was a former horse trainer from Sydney called John Morish. Uh it's a tragic story. He'd been on a hunting trip about a hundred and thirty kilometres west of Catherine  fifty-three years of age he suffered a fatal wound on the left side of his chest  just before midday on Saturday. Police have been investigating but they say there are no suspicious circumstances. John Morish had trained a a string of outstanding gallopers Uh March Hare being one of them. He'd also been associate with Takeover Target uh Clocker was another one. He's died in a shooting incident at the age of uh fifty-three but police say no suspicious circumstances.



 Yes you're too valuable to lose to a bad mobile phone Raelene.

 Sorry about that John.

 It's alright it's not your fault. Uh now tell me uh you you were mentioning some of the the symptoms a distended tummy was one you said.

 Distended tummy a bit of diarrhoea um just generally feeling unwell  can be some of the symptol simple symptoms it's not something that  sort of jumps at you like breast cancer does where some of the symptoms are are very obvious.

 Dih did  do you feel any pain.

 Look I'm sure that you feel unwell I I was lucky I had a dog that chased another dog when I was walking it one night and tore the the mass the twelve centimetre mass that was growing in my back  attached to my right ovary.

 And that's how it was discovered.

 And that's how it was covery discovered she tore the mass and it bled into my back causing acute pain and I went to the doctor had an ultrasound and had surgery within a matter of days.

 Well you were unlucky but lucky in a way weren't you.

 I was very lucky. I don't see it as unlucky at all I see it as very lucky and then mine unfortunately grew back and so thirteen months later I had a second dose of it where they had to go back inside and take a lot more stuff out.

 Uh are you right now are you in remission.

 Look I hate that word. Um I'm well at the moment. I I sort of see the word remission as a as a symbol that it's gonna come back. 

 Yeah I do too.  I do too.

 Exactly I just live every day as it comes and I believe that I make the most of them uh and and I look forward to a future. I don't think about the fact that maybe I am in remission  and the word remission to me symbolises that it I'm sitting around waiting for it to come back and I'm not.

 How how many Australian women are diagnosed with uh ovarian cancer every year.

 It's about two and a half thousand a year. And.

 It's a lot.

 The terrible the terrible statistic is that one dies every  hours. So about seventy percent of women who are diagnosed um die within five years I think it is.

 Is that right.

 Yeah it's very scary. 

 And ih is it correct that there's there's no test for it. How how do they discover it if there's no test for it.

 Well there's no early detection test like with with breast cancer you can have mammograms or you can have biopsies on lumps or various things with ovarian cancer there's just no early detection test for it. Um and that's what our research group are working on an early detection test particularly focused at the moment on post-menopausal women.

 I see is it more prevalent in post-menopausal women.

 Yes. Yes it is it sort of rears its ugly head when the hormones start to go berserk through menopause I think.

 Yeah and uh w what do women do if they have a concern uh if there's if  there's no test there's not a lotta point in talking to your doctor.

 Oh no there is you go to the doctor your and you talk to your your G P and obviously he would refer the woman if he thought there was something to be checked on to a surgeon and the surgeon would do ultrasounds and check it out very thoroughly um to make sure there were no shadows around the abdominal cavity there and and um and then it would be taken to the next step of surgery and then on to chemo or whatever was necessary or it would just be monitored.

 Okay it's a bit frightening isn't it.

 It's very frightening but when you see a big corporate like the National Bank getting behind raising funds you appreciate how much good they do in the community and and this is based around funding from the National Bank in in partnership with the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation  who put.

 How can we help Raelene.

 You can help by or your your you and your listeners can help by going and buying a two dollar ribbon from any National branch. Any National Bank branch they have them on their counters and you'd be surprised how quickly the two dollars add up. When you think about it  you know a very basic poi a um perspective we only need to sell two-hundred-and-fifty-thousand ribbons to raise the half a million dollars we want  and um I hope that a lotta your listeners go out and spend that two dollars.

 Okay I'm sure they will Raelene. It was lovely to talk to you and uh I hope you remain fit and well I'm sure you will.

 Likewise John thank you.

 Thank you bye.

 Bye.

 Raelene Boyle wonderful woman and uh really been a great athlete and uh a w a wonderful personality and now helping  the Ovarian Cancer Research Foundation so if you're in the uh bank and you see the silver ribbon buy one costs you two bucks but it might well be  the best two dollars you've ever spent if it's gunna help discover ovarian cancer  uh maybe you're not concerned about it but maybe you have family young  children women in your family who uh may worry about it one day. So if you can buy the the silver ribbon make a point of doing it would you.



 This is interesting uh. Several truck drivers are going to wear blindfo   to a meeting with WorkCover putting pressure on  uh WorkCover to investigate all truck driver deaths in road crashes they're wearing blindfolds claiming  that Workcover is turning a blind eye to their problems and I think they're absolutely right.



 Karen are you there.

 It's Kerryn yes John.

 Kerryn okay.

 Um I have an a my daughter has an appointment at the Royal Brisbane Women's Hospital this morning  we've rocked up but you you can't get anywhere near the place. Um there's a suspected bomb in a car parked outside the casualty entrance  at the Royal Women's Royal Brisbane Hospital.

 Really.

 Yeah  bloody terrible.

 Has has uh has anybody told you that this a suspected bomb.

 They there's police everywhere there's a guy in green suit they're just sending a sniffer dog up there now they've been through the car it looks like they're gunna try to open it at the moment.

 Okay how far away are you.

 In the garage in the next street just across the road actually.

 But you can see.

 Yep.

 Are there many police there.

 There is there's quite a few yeah.

 Okay and uh wuh. 

 Oh they've opened the car door.

 Okay well you just hang on and tell me what's happening they've opened the car door.

 And the policeman that isn't in the protective gear has come back down to another policeman under the be behind the um brick fence.

 Yeah would that indicate to you by uh his actions that there isn't a problem. 

 Oh dunno they're bending down they're being very very cautious.

 Okay so uh.

  they're just about to send the dog up by the look of it.

 Okay so w when you say they're bending they're they're crouching down.

 Crouching down yep.

 So obviously they think that there's still some kind of problem there.

 Yep well the the hospital's closed. We um.

 What what t what time did you get to the hospital.

 Uh quarter past eleven.

 Okay and uh it was bad then. Was  closed was closed then.

 Yes.

 Have you got any idea what time they closed it.

 No no sorry.

 So so w it was already closed when you got there.

 I'm very well how are you.

 Good thank you.

 Why did you call me.

 Well uh this coming month is the uh first year anniversary of my wife's death she died from ovarian cancer.

 How old was your wife.

 Uh she was thirty-nine.

 Tt tt tt goodness gracious. I'm sorry to hear that.

 Mm  we didn't  it was one of those routine check-ups we we wouldn't have known otherwise it was there and they discovered a ten centimetre mass inside the left ovary. And uh when they pulled it out they said it was an extremely rare type of uh ovarian cancer  and there was really um y'know that they they apparently they thought they got it all but then uh after the surgery uh six months later they discovered a second mass that was attached to the back of the abdomen and they couldn't get that out and they they said there was nothing they could do.

 Dear dear dear that's terrible that really is terrible have you got children.

 Three small children yeah.

 Yeah. Are you getting by okay.

 Yes we have a lot of support um and uh a lot of family here so yeah we we have support we need.

 Tell me this were there uh obviously you telling me there were no symptoms. She just went to have a check-up huh.

 Yeah it was just a routine uh check-up and uh he said there's there's something there and they took her for the ultrasound and and uh came back and that's what it was.

 Dear dear dear. So she didn't have any pain or.

 Uh not at that time no. Um the the second one um oh even the second one there wasn't a lot of pain to begin with. Uh but uh y'know as the months went on it increased increased and then just in the last probably two or three months it just rapidly deteriorated until sh y'know at the end she couldn't move couldn't speak couldn't do anything.

 Terrible.

 And that was it.

 Terrible. Okay well it's uh your call is a good warning for other people it obviously doesn't simply happen to post-menopausal women  it can happen to thirty thirty-nine did you say.

 Sharina at two U E dot com dot A U.



 Let's begin with a song. Let's uh let's play this is a good Saturday night song.

 Sounds pretty good I love this.

 Kim Mazelle on Sharina's Saturday Nights.



 Sharina's Saturday Nights and Kim Mazelle there.



 And we're spor ihs we're s  tongue tied we're speaking with Cam. Cam.

 . Hi.

 Is that your  name.

 Sorry.

 Cam.

 Yeah yeah.

 Hi how are you.

 Good how are you I'm a first-time caller so I'm a bit nervous.

 Bit nervous oh you don't need to be . What's your question doll.

 Um I'm  my love life uh well uh I'm in relationship at the  I'm in a relationship at the moment I just need to know where it's going how it's going.

 Okay well the number that you're in  cyclewise is the number three . Uh I beg your pardon it's the number nine. Uh you add the numbers s thr thirteen plus eight which gives you a three and then you add six for the year two-thousand-and-four so I'm just letting all the rest of the listeners out there know how they can work out their numbers so they can participate in some of the readings as well. Okay so you're in a number nine which is not the best time  uh to start relationships 'cos usually it's an ending time. But not everything will end in a number nine cycle it's just if you're moving in the same directions you're making the same decisions or you're planning together for the future then of course you go through it together . And I feel  really at the moment  this month of September will make or break your relationship and you seem to be making some decisions around that in this this month that we're in at the moment. There's fresh new starts for you there in October you've got some good news coming your way in October and in December you've got nothing but socially having uh wonderful times meeting lots and lots of new people so I'm sort of basically seeing here that the relationship there will make you'll know where it stands towards the end of this month. Whether you you're going to it's going to get stronger or it's sorta going to start to to y'know fizzle off  so that would be a time there but you've certainly got three good months coming up.

 Okay.

 And I'll just give you a spin of the wheel.



 Okay. Oh that's a very good card you got the card for the sun which is basically the sun shines on your whole life 'n' it's a very positive card  and there's a lot of growth there ihs with yourself and also you've got s you seem to have some rewards coming your way for past kind actions.

 Oh um excellent.

 And because you're a first-time caller I'd like to give you a nice uh little psychic pack to start reading on so I'll put you back to the switch and  we'll get your particulars. Thanks  for calling have  a great night.

 You too.



 Okay we're talking to Shaz. G'day Shaz.

 Uh hi Sharina um thank you very much for taking my call and I think your show's really great . You've got me adding up everything .

 Yeah that's what happens and and it can drive you mad a bit really.

 Uh it is a bit yeah.

 You start adding up houses you start adding up cars .

 Everything everything.

 I know.

 Yeah.

 You've gotta learn to switch off sometimes but it  you really start to see coincidences don't you.

 You do and I've worked out  all the family cycle and what we're in and oh this is why that's happening but anyway. Uh  .

 She's good.

 Yeah. We're.

 Oh replacement for me when I take a holiday.

 No no no no no no no. Um we're um planning our family holiday to Bali next week and I've been trying to get on to you for weeks and I was just wondering um like how you thought that'd all go I've been bit worried you know  with um y'know just hearing different things that people have said and I just wondered what you had to say.

 What about Bali or about the travelling  situation.

 Yeah just about if you think that we'll have a good holiday and it'll be good trip and things like that that. Uh I'm just worried like ga  travelling with the kids and y'know Bali belly and all that sort of thing yeah.

 Sure. Okay well the cycle that you're in there at the moment . At your as you probably already know is the number six.

 Yep.

 And then you look for number noh nuv uh November September . Six and nine gives you another six . So you're in a double six whammy so it looks like your going to have a great time.

 Oh good.

 Straight away see how you get the double six.

 Yeah I've got a double six and I've worked out everyone else's but I'm the mum I'm thinking so I've goh if the kids have a good ty if I'm having a good time that means the kids will I hope.

 Oh  it sounds like you'll have a ball and Spencer's just got back from Bali.

 Oh okay.

 Whereabouts are you staying over there.

 Um in Kuta.

 Okay  fantastic you'll have a ball. Just  with the Bali belly.

 Yeah.

 Take some Buscopan and you'll be fine.

 Oh okay then.

 Gee you're an expert now.

 Just take two or three packs because you never know 'n' before you go out for dinner maybe just take one or two.

 Oh alright.

 Yeah I think it's always  uh I think when y when ever you're going s uh overseas it's always good to sorta take a little couple  of precautions anyway .

 Oh it's like I'm a bit obsessive compulsive when it comes to my kids and the poor kids I drive them mad  but um  yeah and I'm trying to work out what I have on my list and I thought I'll give Sharenda  a call and see what she's got to say and if  you've given me a positive vibe than I'm happy with that.

 Well looks positive to me uh looks like you're gonna have a ball.

 Oh great. Oh good.

 Okay how about a spin of the wheel too.

 Oh yeah I'm a bit scared of that but okay.

 Oh why not.  Okay you've got card the wheel of fortune so that's really good luck and when you get the card of the wheel of fortune  for instance if you ask a question about finances and you get the wheel of fortune well that that's the turn of your finances. If you're asking a question like yourself what you've asked now is to do with travel 'n' you've got the wheel of fortune that's turning in your favour . Why I think it's going to be great.

 Oh good thank you very much.

 And you're as long as you're careful I mean y'know we've all gotta be careful these days with  the way the world is  but you've gotta be positive as well haven't you.

 Yeah you do.

 Oh have a great time.

 And thank you again and I think your show's really great and you're a really wonderful and a positive person to have on the air and you're great to listen to.

 You've gotta have C D then . Got to have a C D.

 No I didn't say it for that reason I .

 No you're having a Deni Hines C D  I've got one and it and it's and That Word L O V E 'n' Ain't no Sunshine are some of the songs on the Definite  Collection C D Deni Hines . Coming out to you by Allied Express.

 Thank you.

 Have a great time let us know uh when you get back how it was.

 Oh I will thank you.

 Okay.



 Okay and we're talking to Sophie.

 Hi how are you.

 Good love how you going.

 I'm good thank you .

 Good for you.

 Um yeah no I was just like oh dunno it's a bit like cliche but I was just wondering about my love life 'n' how  it's all.

 How has your love been.

 Well I'm not sure  like I've. I'm always so indecisive about everything so I y'know I question everything and y'know there's a new guy in the scene but I'm not really thought quite sure whether it's  a good thing or a bad thing. And I bet lots of uh women relate to me right now  so  yeah.

 Well tell you what. Look. You are going now I this is I know this is noth not to do with your love life.

 Yep.

 But this initial of yours as an S initial   and you're born on the tenth that is  dynamite you're a  dynamic girl  and you are going to be really successful in life.

 Oh that's so good to hear.

 You really are . Okay so that's to do with your business and your career and everything's going to take off like a rocket. You'll   your own business or be a boss ih and you can be quite bossy too .

 Oh we'll relate to that yeah.

 This is a good thing yeah g you like to be the boss.

 Huh yeah.

 Back to the love life. Where you are there at the moment you're in you've got the number  okay you've got uh l let me just look tenth of fourth gives you a five and six 'n' five's eleven's a two. Okay there's there's always there's heaps of love it's like there's a lot of people really sort of y'know really going to sort of swoon you or ask you out all that sort of thing going on because you're in a two . Two cycle right up until April . Then you you have got so much travel you've got lots and lots of just more at more of a s a more serious situation to do with relationships half way of next year . Here at the moment what you're doing is just having lots of fun s 'cos you feel really restless.

 Yeah yep for sure.

 And it's sorta like you've got yeah you feel really restless and as soon as y y you sort of like you get who you fancy or they start sort of if they start to s like call you up too much they suffocate you. You run a mile.

 Yeah.

 You like the chase  you like the  you like the butterfly in the in the stomach feeling the  that's what's part of the excitement and all that . And I feel that someone really really special's going to come in   to your life probably that will be like a soul mate connection about half of next year and that's not to say that you c you n haven't got a nice relationship or two at the moment  so it's just nothing but such a ball of fun.

 Oh okay yeah.

 And you're going to spend a lot of time overseas over the next I'd say the next five years . Lots and lots of that . Lots and lots of travel is everywhere.

 Oh fantastic yep.

 Everywhere well you know how you can see this your first pinnacle cycle's a number five . So that's why you've got this restlessness the five is it's very hard like you may think you want to settle down but hey they've gotta catch you.

 Yeah.

 You can run pretty fast.

 Yep.

 So they're after you with that so you've got so much excitement you've you're really broadening your horizons you're just really going to have lots and lots of fun so  that's what I'm seeing there for you . And how about I'll just have a look there at the card for you.  Okay what's all that noise in the backyard is that a dog barking.

 No no no not at all. Oh it's someone's yelling in the background so .

 Oh it's yelling oh okay. 

 Yes.

 Oh look at this you've got a decision between two. A d a decision between two men.

 Oh okay .

 Oh tell you what.

 She's  not giving much away though is she.

 Yes  yes it looks good it look n there's nothing but excitement there for you and just enjoy and  enjoy every moment go out  and just meet. No you've got one I'd say there's more of a serious one about half of next year I think just keep going and enjoying yourself.

 Have fun yeah.

 Have fun because you've got so much experience to go through over the and so much opportunities and so much travel just enjoy yourself.

 Yeah for sure okay.

 That would look fantastic.

 Yeah thank you very much.

 Cool  thanks a lot.

 So accurate . You said everything that's on my mind so  yeah that's really good  . Thank you so much for that.

 Thank you. Bye.

 This is Sharina's Saturday Nights back with more in just a moment and from nine-thirty the tarot stars.



 And of course we'll be also going across to some emails on Sharina at Two U E dot com dot A U be listening in. When you do send them write Saturday or Sunday on them as well because we're getting a lot of double backs coming back saying oh uh y'know about the Sundays and things but write Saturday Sunday on them. Okay and we're talking with Anna.

 Hello Sharina how are you.

 I'm really well thanks yourself.

 Good.

 That's good.

 Um you got a great show there I listen to you nearly every Sunday.

 Oh thanks.

 Um I was just wondering what's happening with my um social or love life or if I'm gunna have one or if I'm not gunna have one .

 Okay. Alright. Y you yourself there at the moment are at a time in your life now have a look at this have you got a paper and pen.

 No I haven't.

 Alright well can you remember.

 Oh yeah I suppose so.

 Okay well your A initial's a number one in numerology.

 Yes.

 And then you're you're born with the number one.

 Mhm.

 Which is your number one day number . And if you add day and month together one and nine's ten.

 Mhm.

 Plus seven uh plus six for two-thousand-and-four you're in a number seven cycle . Okay now a number seven cycle with your particular one initial which you're an independent girl like you don't sort of like to you wouldn't pick the phone up and say oh what's going on you don't like people to sort of think that that you've got nothing happening or you don't like to  burden y y you're not a pushy person that way if you know what I mean  to sort of go and do things. Uh I feel in this particular time you're reassessing a lot of priorities in your life. You're looking at what's missing in your life  and I feel  relationshipwise for you  there's going to be a commitment or a very strong s uh relationship that you'll make some major decisions. I feel after Christmas I don't sorta see anything  a bit of turbulence before Christmas but after Christmas you've got a smoother run especially that period around August is really lucky for you because you're picking up this double eight whammy in the month of August of next year . And that'd be really positive. August September onwards but we've just got like a little I guess you'd call a little black spot there at the moment.

 A sleepy time.

 Yeah it's sort of like hey Anna we wanna stop you. We want to stop you and take a long hard look at your life and where you want it to go it's like a major turning point major change of direction. It's a time that you feel like you're taking ten steps forward but you're taking twelve steps back. You're feeling vulnerable you don't really feel like if something you've you've got this it's like you're not full uh you're not a a complete I guess that would more be the word. And this is all starting to sort of like your intuition's really strong it's a spiritual time. It's sort of like your il oh I guess one word I would use is like an awakening so all the experiences that are going to start to happen probably already have started to happen  between now and the end of the year are sort of saying oh okay y'know lookih making you I guess make s the necessary changes so that the right relationships or people in your life what you want to take forward will go forward with you and what you sort of wanna l leave behind will leave behind it's sorta like there's all this.

 Oh so you're you're saying I'm analysing the type of person that I'd like to be with I'm thinking about it.

 Well not so much it's like w you're reassessing priorities. And it's just a time that when you have this number seven it's sorta like a time you specialise in some sort of field or you sort of look at who's ih the two words let go of anything like emotional baggage clutter it's sorta like you're making some endings and you're making a lot of changes within yourself.  You're changing as a person so that you're going to start to attract and we're not just talking about love life as such  we're talking about the whole of your life as in friends there's new friends there's different people you're you're doing a course you you've got this   and I feel uh as you change you're going to attract some really really wonderful friends and love life is really going to really look really good. So don't sort of think to yourself oh I've gotta wait till August of next year that's not the case at all 'cos you know yourself.

 Start working now.

 No but it's just basically it's not like you gotta wait till August of next year that would be a time ih these things take time to sorta sell it whatever. But by that time even before that time but that would be my prediction would be a really really wonderful time for you in your life which you'll really be happy.

 Oh excellent.

 Absolutely and what you wanna do is some little s y'know do your little feng shui that we talk about all the time all the little tips. With spring coming up it's also time to sorta get the gardens going  and when you walk into a garden or a balcony  uh you want to like when you enter the yard the very very far right corner of the yard put something there that's maybe a pink tree y'know a pinky bushy thing uh something pink something red. Something red and white in that area roses  anything like listen to Jennifer Stackhouse for the gardening show and get some tips that things that'll grow in Spring or the gardening shop but but that sort of area there 'n' on your balcony as well. You've got the card also of the judgement which is the soul searching making ih really makes sense in altogether with your seven cycles so I think it's really quite an interesting time ahead and I think that you'll really grow as a person and and really like what you see.

 Yeah 'cos I've got a quite a few things happening with the sale of the house and it hasn't coh quite gone through yet and there's a lot of things happening.

 Exactly it's that these are all the changes taking place so that all of this positive energies all that it's sorta like you're letting go and moving on. That's all looking really good.

 Oh great.

 And thank for calling through.

 Thank you very very much.

 And have a lovely night.



 Okay and of course we've goh we're talking now with Joseph.

 How are you Sharina.

 I'm really well Joseph yourself.

 Yeah look really good look I love the show it makes for a great Saturday night so I'm just listening to those happy uh people at the start of the show makes for a great night I think.

 I think so it sets the tone doesn't it.

 Yeah it does.

 Mm.

 Now look mine's a really specific question. It's around finances trying to sell a house at the moment. Have been unsuccessful in doing that but um y'know still positive about trying to get rid of it so sort of just wanna see what you see for it.

 But is this your birth date here the seventh of the seventh seventy-one.

 It is.

 Have a go at all the sevens.

 Yeah.

 Unbelievable.

 Yeah it's a.

 If if your anyone that has more than two numbers like say you have uh you've got for thih ih for sake here there's three sevens . Right. You're an expert on human nature with those sevens 'n' you got the three sevens. You are really really intuitive. And you would actually also have really good healing energy and even if you weren't using your hands what would actually happen you could sorta it's sometimes it's like just with your words with people to put them you've got a way of of convincing people to put them like they say they've lost the track  to turn their way of thought around and put them back on the on the right track and  k it's a real gift . You haven't noticed that with people.

 Oh oh I probably don't notice it but y'know probably people around me would probably notice it maybe . I definitely don't notice it.

 Absoluh well you you look at those numbers there there's seven there's seven and seven it's incredible.

 Oh okay.

 Mm. Now with the cycle there you've got that is a fourteen's a five and a six is an eleven cycle. Yeah see the eleven cycle. Okay it's it's interesting it can be really really wonderful for some people and then on the other hand it can be really really slow it's like one of those cycles that just takes forever for  things to take place . And especially 'cos I know when I went through an eleven cycle I sort of uh while back and you think about selling at that time and and it's sorta like partial I guess the two words I would use is partial success . And once you head towards that three cycle which you're coming up to next year it just like you would put the house on the market in a three cycle and it would hih sell a lot quicker than it would in a two cycle if you know what I mean.

 Oh okay when's my three cycle start then.

 It starts next July.

 Oh okay.

 But that whole year starts the tone it sets the tones. That doesn't mean that it's not going to sell on a two it's just that things sort of take it's a slow approach it's a it's  it's everything takes forever.

 So maybe I need to be patient 'n'.

 Be p exactly  be patient. Alright. Now you've got that there so it's definitely going to take place 'cos a change of residence and everything's there for you for next year which is two-thousand-and-five if not before. Now two-thousand-and-five for you is going to be absolutely brilliant for you to do with finances. And that's your question on finances.

 Okay.

 And it you'll find because you'll pick that number three up and that number three will work very well with your J initial. The combination's quite good and you'll find yourself also with that number seven that when you're actually in a seven cycle further down the track when you'll have pick up four s your three sevens plus you'll have the seven cycle which is say four years off that your ih your intuition will just you'll walk down the street and just get vibes about things it's just all going to develop between now and the next four years stronger than ever. And I would write the word sold on any advertisements for the property . And I also would put yourself at the front 'n' the back door steps and a jade plant or a succulents plant. And make sure there's no clutter around because it's definitely going to be all happening for you it's just be a little patient in this particular time.

 Okay  okay that all sounds wonderful.

 And listen I'll tell you what we've got for you. We're got a w a s now how do we say this. A five System Seven Oz Lotto entry.

 Let me check uh oh s um s uh System Seven Lotto entry.

 Yes it's got f oh the five.

 We have five of them to  give away.

 Yes five was next  I thought it might've been a new .

 Just give him one.

 Okay alright .

  You're fine with that aren't you Joseph.

 Oh look I'm more than fine with that  . I'm more than fine with the reading to be honest with you.

 No I wanna give  that to you. Okay that's a System and and that's coming out so hold on to the line. We'll put you back to the switch and we'll you'll get that out to you which is the System  Seven Oz Lotto by Allied Express.

 And just before we go to the tarot stars we have the spell of the week with Siobhana we cross live. Siobhana.

 Hi Sharina how are you.

 Looking forward to seeing you at Canterbury.

 Oh I'm looking forward to it yes. Looking forward to seeing your show.

 Oh I can't wait.

 Yes.

 Now what have you got tonight what  what's happening.

 I've got a a spell it's a lovely spell it's to keep your loved ones safe while they travel.

 Oh well we've had a couple of travel questions tonight on the program.

 Well there you go it's the time of year spring and everyone starts thinking of  y'know looking around a bit outta hibernation and. So I thought well what's the best thing whenev ever anyone goes away that we love all we want for is for them to be safe and happy so I thought well I'll give the  spell tonight.

 Okay let's go.

 Okay we need a red candle.

 Yep.

 Eucalyptus oil. Now if you don't like eucalyptus oil burning in the burner you can use geranium it has the same effect. Um several clover leaves. A small piece of red satin about as big as a p a small plate. Gold thread or gold ribbon and a small piece of black hemalite   which is a little black stone iron stone.

 Okay run over that again.

 Okay a red candle.

 Red candle.

 Eucalyptus oil. Or geranium oil.

 Eucalyptus or geranium oil yep.

 Mhm  uh several clover leaves.

 How many.

 Several.

 Several yeah.

 Yeah anything from three to twenty. Uh a small piece of red satin.

 Red satin.

 Gold thread or gold ribbon.

 Yep.

 And a black a small piece of black hematite.

 Mhm.

 Which is your little black stone. Okay so you start by heating the oil and doing your breathing getting yourself into  into that place where you have to be. Put the satin down and the  uh nice and flat and put the stone in the centre. The red candle goes at twelve o'clock light the candle and scatter the clover leaves. And then once you've done that you say the one I love and hold so dear is travelling far away from here. Keep conditions calm and clear hold them safe and free from fear. Now you say that three times. Then you wrap the stone in the satin the g finishing off with the gold ribbon and you ask your love one to carry that with them until they return safely.

 Oh that's lovely.

 It is nice and n uh t a secondary thing is  you can keep the um  the clover leaves yourself you put them in a little red envelope and pop them next to your bed and whenever you wanna send  y'know bit of extra good wishes or you're thinking of your travelling love one  you've got that there.

 Okay run over it again we we need.

 Some eucalyptus oil.

 Eucalyptus oil several clovers.

 Yes.

 Red satin.

 Yes.

 Gold thread.

 That's right. And a small piece of black hemalite . Hematite sorry. Always say that one wrong. And uh we heat the oil.

 Heat the oil yep.

 Place the satin down put the stone in the middle sprinkle over the clover leaves . And then say  the one I love and hold so dear  is travelling far away from here.

 G'day John.  Hello John.

 Hello good evening.

 Good evening to you.  Hello.

 Yes yes I'm here uh uh do uh m do you want my date I l I gave my date of birth .

 Yeah I've got that yeah.

 R right.

 Okay you're born the ninth the eighth.

 Yeah.

 Okay yep uh what's your question.

 I just asked the  the lady the what what the future with the numbers are and  uh y'know just things like that.

 Okay alright well you're you're in a number uh how you get your day number. Your day number's nine. Nine and eight's seventeen gives you an eight and then of course two-thousand-and-four is a six. So the number you're in's a five personal year at the moment.

 And does that  keep going all the time.

 No it lasts for twelve months. And then when you're in the cycle next year which will be August uh when your birthday hits you go into a six cycle. Then the year after that you go into a seven then the year after that you go into an eight cycle  so it just changes each year . Where you are at the moment you've just gone into a five. So you're feeling restless. The next twelve months will be a big turning point. You'll feel like it's it's lots of doors closing new ones about to open. And you'll also find that there will be lots of interesting new connections coming into your life. There'll be lots of opportunities to make positive and I'm talking positive changes in your life. It should be filled of action. Filled of also lots and lots of  I guess travel. I guess long distance communication   turning point and it's sort of like a time that you you you really your patience will be put to the test because you feel like you want everything to happen straight away and you're feeling like oh quick quick I want things to happen they're not happening. But they are it's because you you feel more restless when you've got this particular number. Uh March will give you a lot of financial dividends because you're picking up a number eight in that month of March of next year. And February so those two months w will be look look very promising to do with finances and to do with kicking huge goals and to do with wishes coming true uh they look like dynamite months for you. And between now and then everything won't be the same it's like you're a new person it's in actually one word I would use it's reinventing. It's like you're reinventing it's like a new a brand new John.

 Huh jeez that'd be a surprise.

 Absolutely  That's what I say . Well that'll be good for you anyway.



 We have the news coming up in just a second and we're back with hour two on Sharina's Saturday Nights. Uh a little bit later tonight as well Shelley Ackerman will be joining us from I believe Germany she's still in Germany .

 Is that where she is.

 We'll find out from Shelley a little later. Uh plenty of your calls s still to come as well the number's thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two. Email Sharina at Two U E dot com dot A U.



 Now you can go for your life.

 Okay Bonnie hi Bon.

 Hi how are you .

 I'm good doll yourself.

 Yeah well thank you.

 That's good.

 Yeah.

 Okay what can I do for you hun.

 Um I'm just wondering I'm just finishing university at the moment and I'm a bit confused about what I'll be doing next year uh d like. I'm sort of at a crossroads I don't really know what to do  myself so I'm just wondering um  yeah if you could.

 Well you you yourself you yourself you're born that with that twenty-seven day number you thinking of psychology or anything like that.

 Um.

 W with that twenty-seven that you've got there that's a  like and you could end up being a teacher as well they're teacher's numbers they're psychology  or counselling. .

 Oh okay. Um that's  what my mum does actually .

 Oh really.

 Yeah . At the moment . Um yeah I'm I'm like I'm not sure whether I if I should go travelling or if I should take on a full-time job. 'Cos I've been offered a job but um yeah I don't know whether   to take it or not and. Yeah so yeah I'm not really not I don't really know what to do. Or then or stay on with study a bit more so.

 Well you know  what I think you're going to do.

 What will I do .

 I I'm all in favour of you taking a trip.

 Yeah.

 A short trip but really because you've got this your birthday's coming up next month and you've got  a seven cycle . And I think that the sev see the seven cycle's the best time to study because you you really take it in it's this need the mind wants to learn  the m the mind wants to do all this . So I think so Bonnie  I really think that you're going to study. And I think that you're going to end up doing being in a teaching role. And I do think you're going to go ahead and do something in that y'know that  that psychology or something in that sort of field of the healing the medis medicine whatever . Uh  and I think that the the trip there but I don't see it being a long trip because y you are going to study. That is my opinion there.

 Yeah 'cos I'm contemplating like sort of um teaching overseas next year like um in like in in Japan or somewhere like that.

 Well that would work in really well 'cos as I said to you I see the twenty-seven being the number of a teacher and you've just said you want to teach overseas. Well that would work out well that would that in that case if you're actually uh going on the travelli doing the travel  and teaching that's altogether fantastic  . To do with the numbers . That would be brilliant.

 Yeah and what about um like just in terms of like um my love life like my  'cos I'm with someone at the moment but I'm bit concerned how it'll all work out for next year if I'm sort of going on a different path.

 Well you may separate  for a time because you've got to go and sort of do other things and  I feel that it could be one of those situations that you sort of had the long distance relationship and then it it might sort of start to fizzle a bit and then  the year after. See you're g you're g got to realise you're gunna be meeting so many new people it's gunna be very hard to hold a relationship  uh down but I really feel for you that would probably the year two-thousand-and-six would be a really really good thing when you'll have your act together and what you'll y'know a time of permanency in your life. At the moment I still see that the relationship will last  but it's going to uh wuh obviously if if you're going off to do this sort of thing that's  going to be at a distance that have to sort of y'know maybe separate for a  a short time I don't think it's for the long term. But that's  the main thing I'm seeing for you there  is that teaching as I mentioned at the at the beginning of the of the reading which is fabulous  and you've got the card here . The card here I've got is the card of the sun . Now the card of the sun is shining on your whole life and that is just so good to have the card of this . It's just a fabulous card. Now listen I tell you what I wanna do. I wanna give you a psychic pack so I'll  put you back to the switch for a psychic pack  and also I'll give you a System Seven  Oz Lotto ticket.

 Oh excellent thank you very much .

 Coming out by Allied Express now that's this is Tuesday night's Oz Lotto has jackpotted to a massive three-million. So this is fabulous so put you back to the switch there  and that'll come out to you. Alrighty.

 Excellent thank you so much for that.

 Thanks honey.

 Okay bye.

 Bye.



 And now it's that time again from That's Life magazine telling us what's happening we've got uh some great stories here. My wife lives on in my mate. Chalk and cheese stories opposites attract 'n' little Richard 33:15 Kate Curson to tell us more. Seeh.

 Hello Sharina.

 Senior editor. Oh g'day Kate.

 Hi how're you doing.

 Oh really well it's so busy tonight we're well we're always busy but tonight just seems to be going overboard.

 Really it might be  partly the weather it's pretty uh pretty nasty out there so it's yeah people staying in 'n' and having a sh a chat with you instead .

 Maybe. May uh may I think 'n' y'know what I think it is. It's because it's coming up to spring 'n' everyone wants to know the spring and love's in the air .

 Well that could well be  true yes.

 Everyone's wanting to get some new gear and and all this and wanting to know about their finances as well .

 Oh yes everybody always wants to know about their finances don't they me included .

 Oh yes. So now l what's this my wife lives on in my mate. Wha what's that story about.

 Oh look that's a really touching one that we've got this week um it uh it relates to the whole organ donation issue.

 Oh of course.

 Yes. 

 I see  my wifes lives on my mate yes.

 That's right now  a lovely guy called uh called Gerald spoke to us. Uh from New South Wales and uh he and his wife Pat were very very happily married for thirty years  uh but then she passed away suddenly of a brain aneurysm. Um but just the week before she'd been speaking about they had this conversation about uh her wish to donate her organs. And so when doctors said that she was a candidate for that then uh Gerald knew that's what he had to do. So then thirteen years later he came across an organisation called Transplant Australia uh who offers to put donor families um and recipients in touch with each other. So he thought that that was an interesting idea he wondered y'know if anybody had been kept alive through his wife's uh organs and uh through that he met a guy called uh Bob from Adelaide and the really nice thing is they actually became really really close mates. Uh Bob actually uh was very grateful that um ih that Pat had saved his life and now they see each other whenever possible they've stayed at each other's houses and uh and Gerald was even a special guest at uh at Bob's daughter's wedding so um in a way I guess it's it's quite uh quite nice for Gerald because uh through Bob I suppose he still has a little bit of his wife living on.

 Oh that's beautiful story.

 Yeah.

 Really is. And what's chalk and cheese. Opposites attract.

 Ah well speaking of love being in the air we we take a look  at that this week um  we look at a couple of examples of opposites attracting which is which is quite fun and pretty common I think. Um this week we have uh the princess and the roughneck uh one girl was uh from a private school education uh yeah I think it was reasonably well off and had a good job and um and her partner was um uh was a plumber um probably I don't know from the wrong side of the tracks a little bit uh a little bit more casual with things like uh y'know dress and things like that wore stone-washed jeans and uh slightly daggy outfits. But still they managed to make it work somehow even though they've got uh y'know got uh not not got a lot of things in common I should say.

 And what about little Richard.

 Oh yes thah that's one of our spooky stories we love a good spooky story at That's Life. Um in this case we've got uh a lady who was a ward granny at a local uh Sydney hospital  and she looked after children who's parents couldn't visit very often. Either because they lived in the country or they just couldn't make it in uh very often. One of the babies that this lady looked after was uh a five month old boy Richard who'd been involved ih uh in a serious accident. Um now his condition was looking a little shaky um because of his injuries and uh she spent quite a time with him before he ended up sadly passing away. Um now it was about um oh I think ten months that she'd spent with him but then um the funniest thing was that uh she didn't know when he passed away uh she had actually uh taken some time off then 'n' she was at home  with her husband and she got the very strangest feeling a really cold icy feeling um all of a sudden when she was just sitting in her living room. And uh it seemed to follow her around the house I don't know if you've ever had this  ih um happen or people have reported this to you Sharina that people had an icy feeling before.

 Yes oh heaps heaps of times.

 Yes well anyway her husband actually said to her look acknowledge it just um y'know uh say say hello or a actually just acknowledge that it's there and she did do that saying look it's alright I know you're there  she just had a feeling that it was this little baby Richard. Anyway um so she hadn't known uh anything that had happened to him at that stage but the very next morning um baby Richard's gran phoned saying he'd passed away. Uh now she'd taken down the exact time that the little baby had died and sure enough it was spot on that was  he passed away.

 Amazing.

 Yes  yeah.

 It's just it's wonderful to hear these stories. You're after more stories aren't you. For the magazine.

 Always yes we are.

 For anyone that wants to  I mean there's money for them people that wanting an extra little bit of income with this wuh w talking about their finances.

 Very very true.

 No it's a.

 It's a good way to win some extra cash for sure  so up to five-hundred dollars actually which is  which would help out anybody I think so.

 So ha well they'll just grab the magazine all the details are inside.

 They are  indeed. Yes people can phone in their stories fax them in email them all sorts of different ways and all the details are in the magazine.

 And they can even bring their stories and pictures out next Wednesday to Canterbury.

 Please do that would be wonderful I can't wait.

 Canterbury Hurlstone Park free magazines to win and  also you might get yourself a a bit of a a job uh writing for the mag .  a column . With a not a column a a story  . Okay look forward to seeing you there out at Canterbury on Wednesday.

 Wonderful thank you Sharina I'll see you then.

 Have a great time.

 You too bye-bye.

 Kate Curzon senior editor of That's Life magazine.



 Okay the the lines are open now thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two 'n' we'll be back after this.



 And we're back with calls. Call us on thirteen-thirteen-thirty-two and Gabriel's next. Hi Gabriel.

 Hi Serena .

 How you going.

 Good I just want to know um what's happening in relationships with me please.

 W what's happening sorry.

 In relationships.

 In rela are  you in a relationship.

 No I'm not.

 You're not wuh in one  alright okay so I'll just get your birth date here . Y okay. Uh yeah hang on I've got it on a screen here twenty-eighth of the seventh of eighty-five.

 Yeah that's correct.

 Okay twenty-eight's a one eight tsh uh eight 'n' six 'n' eight's fourteen's a five. Okay you're in a five. Look you've had a rough trot there for the last  t when you have a twenty-eighth day number . You've got two eights in your birth number there you've got the eight and the eighth uh the eighty-five part. And the l probably that was a trying time that woulda been a little bit of heartache there the last twelve months or so . And now you've sort of got this you're the in the bachelor's number. So what you'll start to see is you'll start to find yourself being footloose and fancy free. You'll start to really find yourself really starting to attract lots of new friendships into the picture  and out of these f new friendships one will become permanent in your life. So it's sort of like you're you're out of that that h I guess that black spot in your life . And now you're moving forward y you can expect action you can expect lots and lots of invitations to start to pour in now  just give it a little time here because we've only just gone into this cycle . So I'd say that we're back into I'd say that you're in a committed long-term relationship there  roughly about the month of March . Either you know give or take either side but it's all going to start to happen now  and you're going to start to meet these connections because you got  you got to realise that when you have that bachelor's number you can think that you wanna settle but it's really you're you're going to have the time of your life  it's really fabulous uh out there and what you want to do is just fix up a little bit of feng shui which we talk about on the program . Which is when you walk into your bedroom the very very far right corner put pictures of uh m married couples uh s anything representing love. Family pictures something in a red or a terracotta frame or even a vase that's red or some Phoenix ducks. Uh mandar some mandarin ducks. S ah what else can I think of. Reds even a red box y'know in that area and you can just sort of put an affirmation but that's the colours there. Gar in the gardens  in the backyard a red white those plants together  in that section in the very very far right corner when you look into a room or a garden or a patio. You there.

 Yep yeah.

 Yeah okay so it's looking good so  I'll just give you a spin of the wheel as well.  Little start with your birth numbers there. Okay. Okay we've got the card the star now that's giving you a wish coming true and it's a positive star and I really think that your heart's earnt y'know it's really you've got that  yearning sort of feeling for for a relationship and it will come true for you and I would say that that's sooner than you think.



 Oh I felt like doing the cha-cha for that that duh duh duh duh duh duh  yeah. Okay we've got Marie.

 Marie now how are you.

 I'm good how are you.

 I'm excellent thank you.

 Oh okay .  you sounded it. Someone seems like they're  that everybody out there calling me tonight's been having a glass of wine or something they're all seem so really upbeat or  something  .

 I only had half a glass.

 Oh  you only had half a glass alright   . No it sounds like everyone's at a party or  something y'know tonight. Okay. Yep I think it's just that you can feel that it's sorta like spring in the air sorta thing can't you . It's a difference I think it's sorta like. Do you do you find spring and like getting outta winter you sorta feel lighter or something.

 Uh.

 Y'know what I mean I I've I think that I do I feel that way do you feel that way Spence.

 I think so.

 Yeah.

 I think it's also you don't have to worry about wearing so many jumpers 'n' clothes 'n'  just get dressed that  no that's true I was only thinking about   it t t tonight too. You know you  get the boots on and you got the  on.

 Does that mean you won't be going shopping then for spring.

 Of course I will.

 Yeah oh I need to do that yes.

 Oh yes we'll be out there doing that . Now what can I do for you hun.

 Um I'd just like to know I'm a bit of a crossroad with my career so um that's sort of um the main part and also we've sort of got a race-horse so I  don't know if that's gunna be.

 You've got  a race-horse.

 Yes.

 Oh.

 Just like recently. Um.

 I had we had race-horse at my parents had race-horses when I was growing up uh it's just wonderful.

 Oh I've got horses that I ride.

 Oh jeez I'd love to I I'd love to do that again  have a race-horse I just think that's that's a lovely interest for you.

 Ih ny oh I love horses so. But I just don't know whether this one's gunna be  lucky .

 Lucky okay. Alright so l now let's look at your numbers there to start with you're born  the eighth of the tenth.

 Yes.

 Right. You are in an a magnificent cycle from your birthday you know that don't you.

 Excellent .

 Mm. The eight being a Libran and you change mind all the time.

 True.

 You're a you've got a lotta luck with you at the moment too it's sorta like you've got luck uh and it's starting to go every single day. Right through so  the eight. W wherever there's a number eight  that's a number of power.

 Oh okay.

 And it's also but the eights can also have like it's a karmic number as well and I'm I'm not sorta trying to be negative saying this but I'm just saying that  when you have this number eight uh number  it sort of like can be a time c can be a trying time to deal with it's a one number of balance you've gotta balance relationships with career and we're not talking about at the moment we're talking uhl on a lifetime situation . It's a time of sort of  y you get lots of rots  of rewards. It's a number of business and the eight can basically do any career like you know how I w I was talking to the girl before and I said you'd be good as a teach and she was doing a teacher with a twenty-seven  and then we get the pers the person with a seventeen day number and a eight day number  and those two words highly capable capable of anything . Having your own business  uh making a success of it because you can sort of like  you're the sort of girl that could okay go out there and start a a catering business. Make it successful sick of this move on but you you had a go at it and you saw it through and then you moved into the entertainment industry and you then you you did something there  then you moved onto something else you could do it all you know what I mean.

 Oh that's good.

 You've got that marketing that marketing uh number there too . Very good business sense.

 I'm thinking of g sort of maybe starting my own pr uh business so.

 Well that's exactly what I'm I'm saying.

 Mm.

 Your own business with the eight day number . It's you're highly capable. So you can do anything you want start any sort of business whatever you wanna do. Okay  so that's answered there with the eight cycle  wuh uh coming up you're in a six cycle which is  and see six is particularly good for business. It's good for love  but it's also good for business because your aura attracts and it's like you're communicating much better you'd be very very busy with family you'll be very very busy with uh business with career with new connections and you'll attract everything into your life . Okay now race-horse  tell me about this race-horse will you put ten bucks each way on it or what.

  Well he he's supposed to have ability and then he ran his first race last week and got last but.

 What's his name.

 Um Smudge of Green.

 Is that the Melbourne Cup .

 Yeah w once w we started the show off once with a Melbourne Cup thing like that and you remember  and everybody was running around they're going  what  oh what one w what one woman what what happened somebody rang up and said it thought it they had that the race was on or something  that was  they they didn't have a sense of humour. Okay the the Mudge of Green  alright so w  eh uh well I'll have to probably add up that number I tell you what I'll do.

 Mhm.

 On the break I'll add that up because I haven't got time to do that at the moment but  I'll show you what to do with names 'cos sometimes y see the. Well ha let's do it together so other people can do their name.

 Okay.

 What was the name I'll write it .

 Mudge  of Green.

 Are you sure.

 I like it . Well it's got I've added the whole thing up right  and Spencer did it w he's just checked my adding up. Okay . And we've ended up with a twenty-two when I've added uh the total thing and broke it down  which breaks down to a four but the twenty-two's a master number it starts with an S which is really good I like this it's a it's a hard working it'll put the energy in this this horse it'll put the efforts in it needs to sort of work harder than  y'know it's not gonna come straight away . It's one that you'll have to sort of y'know y'know what I mean keep working  yes yeah and well keep it keep him working he's up to the work and hard work and he'll come through. I like it . How exciting for you I love it.

 I know I love he's only the small little thing but you know ih wih.

 What colour.

 Suh he's chestnut with a star on his face.

 Oh a star.

 .

 Oh I love horses.

 Ih I know  I've got three now.

 I like I like when they're a part of a trifecta as well .

 I'm never lucky enough for that . 

 Yeah I uh I I like doing the trifectas I I once I went out to the races and got I think  the most I've had's been I think four trifectas.

 Oh okay.

 And then one we I usually puh pick four.

 Yeah.

 And box them.

 Oh okay.

 Because then you're sort of like you y y your four and y  but a lot of the times I've found a lot of the times you go out there and and lot of the f  y'know they're they've being paying really short dividends and things.

 Well my dad did it once like years ago and he put the wrong numbers and ended up coming home and it was eleh he had fifty cents for like an eleven-thousand ih like eleven-thousand dollars and he won fifty cents of that.

 What did he have.

 He had a trifecta . But only for like fifty cents not for a dollar . And the trifecta paid like eleven-thousand he put the wrong number on.

 Oh no.

 And he ended up winning it 'n' like he put  the wrong numbers.

 Oh I see okay.

 But the the good way.

 Oh excellent.

 So he got half of like eleven-thousand dollars.

 Oh fantastic. Well listen I tell you what well I'm going to give you a System Seven Oz Lotto entry it's coming out by Allied Express.

 Okay 'n' we've got Carla.

 Hi how you going.

 Good Carla.

 That's good.

 What's your question.

 Oh just guess where am I going I guess what's my next step.

 Where you're going in your next step okay.

 Like y'know in life .

 Oh okay.

 I feel lost at the moment.

 Bit lost w what do you feel like you'd like to do.

 Um.

 Whatta you been thinking about what's all always been your dream.

 Okay I'm at university at the moment and I'm just finishing up and I've always  been interested. I'm in public relations and I've always in always been into the not for profit sector.

 I can't hear  you darl sorry.

 I've always been interested in the not for profit sector.

 Yes.

 And so I'm hoping to get into some sort of   charity work but it's not a lot of money in it I guess but um I don't want to get into corporate P R it stinks so I I just I'm not sure.

 Alright well see with thih with this sixteen number that you've got. The sixteen day number. That is qu and als that's quite a  are the you there doll.

 Yep.

 Can you hear me okay.

 I can.

 Alright wih with this sixteen day number that you've actually got it's quite a spiritual number . 'Cos it adds to a number seven. So that  could be that need as you s mentioned before you wanna do the charity all that sort of thing . Which you actually mentioned.

 Well she's got someone coming up very soon I've added up that up. And and I feel that someone's going to come to do with  the work that you're actually doing around about Christmas at a Christmas party. I really got that vibe as soon as you were actually uh reading that out and I've added the numbers up and that's a really good month there as well.

 Okay let's uh let's head back to calls and talk to Shirley.

 G'day Shirley.

 Hello Sharina.

 How are you darling.

 Pretty good. Yourself.

 Oh pretty good.

 That's good. My hu just a quick question I have a chance to move.

 Yep.

 And um  will I or won't I.

 How do you feel about it.

 Well  I think it'd be good.

 Yeah you're a bit scared to take the  leap into the unknown though aren't you.

 True exactly.

 Uh I know I . I looked at your birth numbers the twenty-four you've sorta like y'know like twenty-four sorta leh you like to feel secure that four coming up ih in in your number.

 Well I've been here for many years but it's  just getting a bit much for me.

 You know what I think.

 What.

 Well  you're in a uh the cycle that you're in. I'm just checking your numbers there's twenty-four's a six and three's a nine. Nine 'n' six nine's a fifteen's a six. Okay six you're in a six personal year . You're in a six personal month for September . Right.

 Yes. 

 That double six there is is and also you were ih you're born on the twenty-fourth which is a six.

 Mhm.

 I think really this is going to be a great thing for you to do because you're looking for harmony. And you're looking to feel you just want and you're a little bit you've been a bit worried where you are  at the moment.

 Yes ih exactly yes.

 And you're thinking to yourself I just want some peace and I just wanna know that I'm settled.

 Exactly I'd love some peace .

 Exactly. That's what you're wanting you're wanting peace you wanna feel settled and I I think it's really I I really do think it's a great thing for you and I know it's frightening and all that  but think of ih think it on th the on the positive I I just get this feel that it's going you're going to end up with some really nice new friends at the place. And I feel that you're going to have  sure you'll have some other friends y'know your past friends but I I do think it's a new lease of life for you and I think really if you're really honest with yourself you're in a bit of a rut. And you would like.

 Very big one.

 Yeah and you would like to sort of you're scared to do this but  I think it's going to be you're going to meet some new friends and everything I I you've got love everywhere like as in the sixth cycle that you're in being a twenty-four day number going to give you that extra vibe that extra sparkle to your aura so that pe you'll start to communicate I'll I I think it's going to c be the making of you. .

 Oh you're wonderful .

 No I really do I think that y'know that that oh uh fixing a little place y'know the new place being in to put your little plants or y'know what I mean.

 Yes I've I've got a tape measure in my purse I carry . As soon as I get the key I'm going  to do some measuring .

 Good for you and I got the bug too and I I thought about that when I was going y'know at the home show and all that and you get that give you a nigh I think that's what you need that'll give you a new interest.

 Yes and when you stop and think you think oh gee am I d right or wrong y'know that's why I thought I'd give you a call.

 Oh look I think that sometimes it just it just really you've made up your mind it's just when you talk to me it's sort of like th a positive person will sort of go okay and I'll go with the energy and a ne negative person'll sort of get y'know stay much the same 'n' you're positive.

 Mm.

 And I think it's going to be a great thing and uh we've got a lovely present to kick you off in your new place.

 On Sharina's Saturday Nights. I'd best not mention the name of the song 'cos I believe we're looking for callers.

 Yeah okay if you guess that you can have a nice uh  prize.

 Okay just  back to uh your memories with that song.

 Yeah.

 What were they. You were telling me something. About that song it was when you were a disco queen what happened . Couple of guys chasing you you said.

 Oh cut it d uh w what's happened to you tonight.

 See I'm sitting on the balcony with the cask of wine.

 Okay yeah yeah  yeah alright. Hi John.

 Hi how you going.

 Good thank you.

 Um just a a normal reading a quick reading and a c c what the next four months has in  in mind for me.

 Absolutely okay you're born the first of the second.

 Correct.

 Alright okay s at that gives you a three six is a nine cycle. Okay number nine cycle. Alright. Number nine there uh in September gives you a number nine because whatever cycle you're in at the moment September will be the same number. 'Cos you're adding a nine so you've got that double nine whammy. So it's like you're finishing a chapter in your life it's like a a nine year  chapter and that's finishing so you're ready for another nine year block if you know what I mean.

 Yes.

 So you've got all  the t oh r right up until the month of probably February. From February onwards you've got a really excellent time for finances. That twelve month period from two-thousand-and-five's going to be really good for you because you've got a J initial you're picking up a number one  and you're going it's time to sort of be bold be daring not sit on the fence sort of be more assertive go for what you want you're going to kick some huge goals I feel and also I feel in that time it's sorta like you've got a lot of soul mate connections like people that you meet in unusual circumstances or highly unexpected times and they seem to sort of just it's like a  well you won't even think they're coincidences you know how you'll get a series of coincidences but they all lead to  new opportunities and oh it's just a really strange you'll you'll sort of question 'n' think wow what's going on it's sorta like destiny really y you can sorta see it shaping up  and I really feel that that time there you'll really reach the heights of success and that would be two-thousand-and-five.

 Alright terrific.

 Mm looks very very good for you uh also  what I'd like to do is with this time with your feng shui around finances. Just in the far left corner of any room in the home  when you enter a room   and look across to the far left corner   make sure there's no clutter in any of those sections there.

 Okay.

 The far left corner like y'know o anything when I say clutter clutter m everyone has clutter to some degree but I'm just saying things that you just don't en has n no use for you anymore . And you've still got them all hoarded there in those areas. So just be careful there on that and also uh a jade plant at your front doorstep's always handy or anything to do with fish fish pictures fish ornaments right through the home.

 Alright terrific.

 Thanks very much for your call John.



 Okay name of the song someone's come through on a hotline. L is it Louise.

 Yes.

 Hi.

 The Time of my Life.

 The Time of my Life.

 Oh okay  well anything  about him or.

 Yes I I can j I can do that for you okay uh five and nine's fourteen's five  fourteen's five six five's are eleven. Okay that's good there since it's eleven it's a two actually uh the cycle you're both in.

 Yes.

 You're the uh very very compatible cycle . Uh here at the moment because you've got the eleven  and you yourself have got the six so the six and the eleven like the eleven's a two they're very all to do with love family and ih that's exactly what it's all about there and passion. Mm mhm.

 Oh okay. Actually I feel like I'm the only one that understands him really.

  Well I tell you what you're going through even though the six and the two cycle are not are are quite similar  and the whole thing is that the you're the next twelve months what you're both going through is all about beautiful love energies very very busy to do with the family and of course I mean that makes sense with the five kids. And also you've got uh lots and lots of really happy tremendous happinence  tremendous emotional fulfilment and happiness coming up and great celebrations and just a beautiful time and I've got to go to the news I'm so sorry but hold on I've got a lovely prize a Don Lane D V D for uh his birthday put you back to the switch.



 On Sharina's Saturday Nights stand by our friend from the United States uh Shelley Ackerman will be joining us.



 And we're having look I'm tsh I'm uh you're going to be stuck with me a little bit longer because we're having trouble getting a where where are we trying to call.

 She's in uh Germany.

 Germany we're having trouble with Shelley Ackerman so I'll have to stay on you'll get stuck with me sorry we are trying to get Shelly. Okay Leanne. Hi.

 Hi.

 How you going.

 Good thank you.

 What's your question.

 Um just would like a general  reading a general overview. Of my life ahead.

 Okay. Uh thirteen's four out of four  okay ye you've got that uh that number four cycle so it's really a busy time . Uh and you'll make a long term decision this month of September you're worried about your finances too you're thinking financial like uh all to do everything to do with sort of like long-term finances all that sort of thing's going on in your mind.

 Mhm.

 Uh just gui guide your health 'cos there could be a few little hickups there to do with your health.

 Okay.

 Around the next three months.

 Right.

 And I feel over the next twelve month period there will be a an increase in your finances  and I would say that's through your own efforts through your own uh generating money yourself it's not sort of a win or anything like that it's yourself.

 Hard work.

 Yeah h yeah  exactly getting in there hard work all that sort of thing. It's sorta like you're climb you're going to be really proud of an achievement . I feel. And I t also feel that you're just sort of like going to be st in a stronger position sorta like you're really going to be proud and more grounded and feel more sec actually the word I'm looking for's secure. You're gunna f  better about yourself . At the moment you don't  and you will you will find that you'll be dumbfounded by what you achieve by about the month of I would say about April.

 Oh okay.

 So I'm feeling also around relationships there's a relationship that's going to end it's sort of like being a a stressful friendship or whatever it's sorta like you're you're whatever's meant  like things are going to end in this time and lots of new experiences will start to take place from about April of next year when you get a really big turning point which'll be really a good time it's sorta like a time that that'll be your harvest . And you're going to have lots of material growth and lots of new friendships and also it's a really nice time to meet people and communicate.



 And now we're talking to of course Pauline.

 Hi.

 Hi Pauline how you going darl.

 Fine thank you.

 That's good.

 Um I'd just like to n know if you could tell me. I had a bit of a nasty experience last Sunday and I just want to know it has affected my relationship and if it's going to continue.

 Well your relationship you're in number six personal year  and you're a fifteen day number as well so  judge that I've only got a few minutes on air uh to look at numbers and things my thoughts here well is that harmony's the key to success and I feel this month of September um I know I've been saying that to a lotta callers tonight about the number September but it's really  because of the nuh month of September what ever cycle you're in you're getting a double whammy of it because  like for instance you're in a six so you add nine you add nine to any of your numbers and you come back to what you've got like six and nine's fifteen is six . You know what I'm saying.

 Yes.

 If a person's in a four four and nine's thirteen that's why you're getting a double whammy in September and that's why I think we're so it's it's the busiest night we've had for  well we're always busy but the switchboard they're ringing every single number's  being called tonight the  lines are going off the hotline number there  there's faxes . Anyway so what I'm saying is uh I think everyone wanting to know what's going on there but I feel that harmony's the key to success I feel that communication will be also the key here choose to communicate if you want this relationship to work it can.

 Oh I do definitely.

 Mm it's up to you.

 Yeah.

 Really. But just have a little bit more confidence in yourself be yourself and stand your ground really and say what's on your mind kih get things off the chest but the number's looking quite good get yourself a rose quartz crystal wear that if you're really worried 'cos that sends out nice energies . Wear some uh pale pink pyjamas  and I know that might sound silly but it really has a a something uh it's like a hypnosis thing with your mind when you wear those colours the pinks it's it's everything to do with pink underwear or pink  uh accessories around the home pink in the garden just put a lotta pink around and that that will get you through but I feel that everything should be fine.

 Oh thank you very much .

 That's my pleasure.

 These experience I had that's not going to  the so called friend has been very very nasty to me.

 The friend.

 Yeah she's been very very nasty giving out my address and phone number uh uh for money.

 Sorry.

 She's been giving out my address and phone number for money. She's been getting the money and I've been getting the callers.

 W what sorta thing's she been doing. Do you  whatta you mean she's been giving out your phone number.

 My phone number and address.

 Yeah.

 And charging certain amounts of money for it and male callers have been calling at my door . Undesirables.

 Gosh.

 And that's caused the little rift in our relationship at the moment.

 Oh look that's that's just communication really. Uh that'll well the tr the truth always wins . Comes out it's not you what a nasty person . Why would she do that.

 Oh because I was happy and she wasn't.

 Yeah jealousy I tell you what that jealousy's a terrible thing you you you see what people what it leads to the jealousy and it's it festers because when people aren't happy with their own life they  that's a terrible uh uh yeah I know a someone like that that any they love to pull put you down as soon as you've got some happiness in your life they've  they can't stand they love  they're in a good mood if you're in unhappy.

 Yeah that's true yes but trust her.

 That's what this friend's like. I mean what sort of people are they.

 Yeah well that's why I have to have police here to remove undesirable people from my door.

 Oh you poor thing.

 Mm and I've had a very hurtful five days very very.

 Have they well have they d what's the police done to her. They got proof.

 No no they can't prove it was her.

 And she was a good friend before to you too wasn't she.

 She was yes a very good friend.

 Oh gee she's got some problems. Well look it's .

 She has.

 Her problem and it's not yours and she's a bit she's gone a little bit nutty.

 Yes true very very true.

 And it's been for some time it's like she's uh the see th this is what jealousy can do it can just turn into a rage can turn uh it's a disease.

 Yeah and she's also told my  the person I'm in the relationship with a whole lotta lies about me.

 Yes yeah I thought so yeah . That's what she's told and see this would devastate you because see what you do in life. People that are born on the sixth or fifteenth you put people up on pedestals  and you don't like to know anything bad about them or other people I I really do believe that other people would've warned you about what she's like but you didn't want to listen.

 Well that's right  yes somebody has told me.

 And you've sort of buh because you don't like to see anything like that you anh really 'n' that's why you crumble so much when something happens to your relationships because you're just devastated because you just can't believe anyone well we all can't believe anyone would be so nasty but I mean you've only gotta see some of the the cruel things that that you've seen on television recently that people do in a rage to exes.

 Mm.

 To harm them when they break up.

 Yeah well I mean this guy now is telling me that he's seeing somebody new but I know that it's definitely not right.

 No I don't think that's right no.

 No.

 No I think you can fix this up I think it's well as I said it's up to you and I think that really get keep away from this uh this friend of yours and I mean really.

 This ex-friend.

 This ex-friend of yours . And really if he's any sort of person he's got to see that I mean as if you would be y'know doing doing that sort of thing y'know what I mean . Bringing them up to your house when you've got him.

 Well that's right that's what I couldn't understand.

 Yeah  look he'll they'll come through but he's sort of when he starts thinking clearly and all that but people can poison other people's minds let me tell you.

 Yes yes I realise that and that's what she's trying to do to him.

 Dreadful . Well I think that you'll just don't give up this and ih basically you've just got to communicate and what you wanna do is as well as is because it means so much to you this relationship and really if he's half the person that you think he is he will come round.

 Oh I hope  so.

 If he belee wants to believe in her well well what sort of y'know really. Uh is that really worth the person in your life that that takes s something that's ka y'know takes her side sorta thing.

 No I think he was just so shocked at the thing.

 Oh hurt hurt's more  like it yeah.

 Yeah.

 Oh sure he'll he's thinking clearly. The I I don't sort of listen keep in contact and let us know how that that uh that the results there . In that relationship.

 Yeah I will.

 Alright darling take care  of yourself.

 Thank you very much.

 Okay pleasure.

 I was just wondering if you could tell me um  in April of two-thousand-and-three  um my husband his family were involved in a big explosion and  my in-laws were killed and my husband was very seriously injured. Now he's still in ho he's still undergoing therapy  overseas. Now  what's going to happen with our relationship because I'm really worried about it. I mean we've been apart for so long.

 Oh gee this is a tricky one this one I I'm really not to talk about anything to do with health on the program oh  the poor   this has been terrible . No I know this is  this is terrible for you darling. How are you how are you standing up.

 I'm not doing very well at the moment.

 How long's it been since you've seen him.

 Um I saw him at c at Christmas.

 You've seen him at Christmas.

 Yeah.

 Okay. I'm.

 So it's still a long time now.

 Yeah sure. So where did you see him at Christmas where w did you go there or.

 Yeah I went there yeah.

 You went over there.

 Yeah.

 Okay you thinking about going back over there.

 I can't afford it at the moment no.

 Okay. And what about his injuries what sort of injursh injuries has he got.

 He's got hip injuries leg injuries and injuries  of the arm and the shoulders.

 Is there a way with what he's actually doing can he like has he lived in Australia was he .

 He has yeah yeah.

 His episode that's oke so  basically is the only reason he's over there is because of the health.

 Yep.   to get him over back here and we can't at the moment.

 Sorry.

 We can't get him back here.

 You can't get him back here.

 No ih we we've tried with medivac and with the ambulance and everything and we can't at the moment.

 Well is there there must be some way that you can a actually get some sorta help. Have you tried I mean all the different avenues.

 Yeah I've tried everything and at the moment he just falls between  like little gaps every when.

 Sorry what was that.

 He falls between im  between gaps so like he doesn't  he he can't go between like uh  not sure if I can explain. He can't the medivac won't evacuate him because it's been too long.

 Mm.

 And  then  look he he just can't do it.

 Oh this is a terrible situation  for you love. Alright well look I tell you what this is uh way out of uh l I guess way out of of  my league really here on the show and I've only I mean this is something this is a more serious   than I can answer in two or three minutes and I wouldn't like to give you the wrong information . I can what I will do I'll look at your numbers and let's just sorta see how how you're sorta spanning out for  the next twelve months and really I think this is there's y'know there's some probably there must be some uh higher people than myself to actually y'know get yourself some information  on on what to do here  y'know what I mean I'm a little bit stuck to be honest . Um li I'm just a numerologist uh okay well I'll just look at the numbers here with the eighteen you're born the eighteenth of the tenth. Nine and one is ten gives you a one and a six is a seven so you're going through some trying times which I I don't  need to tell you that. You are in a number seven  cycle and the seven but the the thing is the seven cycle is very spiritual. And the seven cycle it's whether you get a choice it's whether to be selfish about yourself think me me me me me and I'm not saying that's you I'm just  sorta saying letting the listeners know about  seven or it's a time that you'll get a situation that comes into your life and it sort of tests your strength and your faith and that's exactly what I think's happening here with yourself it's testing your strength it's testing your faith. Now a magazine that I write for called That's Life magazine . There's so many stories in there of people getting back together after you you would never believe some of the stories that you actually read like they were separated for twenty years and they went through all this all this  y'know heartache 'n' 'n' different  situations from yourself obv obviously but but they got back together. And this seven cycle for you sure really praying a lot and I think that really pray prayer would be a a good thing. Saying y y'know your prayers . And also I think  that you focus  on being together  and y where there's a will there wuh there's a way because the following year it's goih it's not goih I don't sorta see it being y'know that that quick it's gunna be a long drawn out thing but  I feel that that my gut tells me that you'll be together next year.

 Oh.

 But it that would be that's my gut  and that would be in the s I'd say after the second part of next year but I really y'know I think this is a little bit not really what I can do on the on the air in cuh s such a short time but I've  just done the best I could  for you. And I wonder who who would you suggest what sort of asso people  out there that we could actually uh talk to. Would there  there must be like Salvation Army or or someone that must have some sort of.

 Mm look I've I've spoken to people from the ambulance 'n'.

 Why don't you try . Yeah well. 

 And no one can do anything.

 Mm.

 It's I've uh I think the one thing is that I've left it too late.

 Well that's what I'm sorta seeing with the  numbers there. So what I would suggest is y'know really prayer because  often if you preh you pray long enough you they'll be answered if they're needed to be answered and also uh get the necessary like try 'n' perhaps you could ring the Salvation Army or whatever and  just get some y'know there must be someone out there that can help you . That's li maybe even listening to this program. What abou the local M P.

 Yeah I might try that.

 There's an election coming up.

 Yes that's right.

 You know there's elections coming up  so see what you can do darl.

 Okay thank you very much.

 Okay hope I c I was able but honestly your your numbers do look very trying but coming out a winner.

 Okay thank you very much.

 God bless you.

" Good morning and welcome to another Two G B weekend it is October the twenty-third it is good to be with you. My name's Luke Bona and Linda Ross is in the garden and our lines are open on one-three-one-eight-seven-three that's the telephone number Two G B dot com if you'd like to send Linda an email and a few have come through during the week Linnie so I'll let you get to work on that.

 Oh thank you Luke.

 Between now and nine good morning sunshine.

 Good morning you how are you.

 Fantas.

 Good morning everyone welcome to the Garden Clinic program on 2 G B it's lovely to have your company with us this morning and we're going into the garden where it's nice and peaceful and quiet and lovely.

 And wet.

 And wet  sopping ih fa in fact absolutely so wet out there isn't it wonderful. And if anyone complains about it disturbing a a function or an event this afternoon  naughty .

 They will get a.

 Big smacks . Absolutely incredible amounts of rain I hope your garden's looking gorgeous. Mine certainly is I'm sure it's grown about five inches over the last week wonderful rain in Sydney and uh and throughout the suburbs. Absolutely terrific we've got a full board of calls but of course you if you wanna ring in one-three-one-eight-seven-three lots of prizes to give away today as well lots of little gardening surprises so stay tuned we've got our lucky member's prize a g really good prize today Yates Pest Oil which I think always comes in handy and let's go to Anne at Bradbury good morning.

 Good morning Linda and Luke. Um I'm ringing about an azalea that we've got it's very healthy it's just finishing flowering and it's been absolutely beautiful but the my question's very specific the previous owners of the house had one of those succulent plants and it was planted very close to the azalea and we've just got rid of that in the last few weeks and so the azalea's very stunted on that side. So we're wondering  not just oh how to prune it anyway but how to p encourage that side to recover and  prune it so it looks less lopsided or what we should be doing.

 Okay well I would just prune it equally all over  and not touch that side.

 Oh okay.

 The extra sunlight and space that it now has because you've removed the succulent will encourage the growth on that side anyway.

 Started to all.

 Exactly and it might take two two years or three years to uh equal out uh but that's really all you can do and of course um spraying or watering with the uh seaweed solutions  whether you choose Maxicrop Seasol or any of the other seaweeds on the market I'm.

 We've got the Maxicrop.

 Beautiful  well that's excellent in fact Maxicrop's terrific.

 But how much do you prune where do you prune down to ab.

 Well I like to just prune ih depending on the bush of course um a well pruned and well maintained bush should only need y y'know two or three inches all over  basically the flowerheads.

 Oh okay that's what  we weren't sure about we  we didn't want to cut it drastically and discover that was the wrong thing to do.

 You can prune drastically don't get me wrong  if something's been let go a cam an azalea is looking completely outright freaky cam  y'know sometimes it gets out of control . You can prune them back hard but no in your case um a short back and sides Anne for you a like  a boy's haircut.

  Okay thanks for that.

 Thank you.

 Have a nice day.

 You too good bye.

 Bye.

 Hello Iris.

 Good morning Linda and Luke. Um we've got a vegie patch which we gave a rest this year f from the winter vegies . We planted annuals um petunias nasturtiums and pansies . And also Mother's Day flowers I can't remember the name
 chrysanthemums.

 Yes chryslyha  chrysanthemums.

 Yeah. But we wanna put the vegies back in in the winter can we dig these over not the chrysanthemums but the others.

 Um.

 Um or should we pull them up and put them in the um compost bin which is best.

 The latter . Put them put them in the p compost bin  if they were legumious  for example legumes like peas  beans  or anyth yeah anything that y'know fixes nitrogen . Uh like pea-shaped flowers  then I would definitely um build it into the soil . But with those annuals I would just put them into the compost and let them compost down.

 Compost down with the chrysanthemums 'cos they would keep going could we dig them up and move them and what time of the year is the best time of the year.

 Well you could do that now  I suppose  yes it's such a lovely w week really  uh we're getting such nice m wuh mild weather I know it's gunna heat up and today will be quite warm . But uh uh I imagine from looking at the weather forecast  but uh yes chrysanthemums are perennials  uh and they do flower in in uh for yuh in Autumn for  Mother's Day  uh and so moving it now is really at the beginning of its life cycle  if you think about yeah the 'n' y y'know y you you'd have a good success rate if you moved it.

 Okay thank you very much.

 My pleasure Iris . Good luck  that sounds lots of fun converting  a flower patch into a vegie patch.

 She's got a big day ahead a fun day  twelve minutes past six shall we go to Greg.

 Let's go to Greg. Good morning.

 Yes good morning luh Linda and Luke uh I was just wondering if you could help me I have a plum tree. Um and I would like to spray it but I don't know what to uh spray it with I don't want to use chemicals.

 Right good well that's great then no spraying  what what would you want to spray it against what are you getting with your plum tree  how.

 Yeah fruit fly.

 Well that's fine you don't have to spray with um to prevent floo fruit fly . When the um plums are starting.

 Yes.

 Then you just put a fruit fly dak pot in the tree.

 A dak pot.

 A dak pot  um and you use some insect killer uh uh there's a one on the market called um uh basically I just think it's called in in fruit fra fruit fly insect killer  and you mix a few little drops of that um into um vegemite and honey  and you put that into uh a dak pot or which is duh y'know just a a plastic drink container  um with some holes and and um some plugs around the outside just so the um uh the fruit fly has an entrance to get in  now the the sweetness of that mix attracts the fruit fly and then the the few drops you could just use the fr um y'know that if you wanted to do an organic method  just the the vegemite and the honey or peanut butter mixed in together  because they usually can't get out. They usually feed themselves . Um but if you want to make it a little bit more potent you could just add a few drops of that fruit fly um uh uh ih in insecticide in there.

 Oh okay thanks a lot for that.

 No worries no spraying nice and easy and safe.

 Okay thanks a lot.

 Thank you Greg.

 Thank you goodbye.

 Bye-bye  and that can be done of course with all fruit. Sorry darling . Peaches plums apples uh or anything that gets the fruit fly you can put the fruit fly dak pots in.

 Uh I was about to say we'll take a break uh the you're right about the weather today Linda you've been listening very carefully  mainly sunny in Sydney's forecast today and a high of twenty-six degrees so a bit warmer . Uh Liverpool twenty-nine and Richmond and Penrith thirty  today  it's mainly sunny. Now Sunday few afternoon showers and thunderstorms. Sydney sixteen to twenty-three tomorrow so it will cool off so more showers on the way on Sunday but today should be mainly sunny a terrific day.

 Do you want me to tell you a little secret.

 Okay.

 Just quickly. Tomorrow is dad's birthday.

 Oh really.

 Yes.

 And he's coming in.

 He's coming in.

 Oh.

 .

 We'll bake a cake.

 .



 Taking calls in the Garden Clinic with Luke and Linda. Jenny from Kurrajong good morning.

 Good morning to you. I've been desperately waiting for Saturday morning so I could  phone you and find out the answer to my problem.

 Oh I'm so glad we can be of help.

 I have started a garden completely from scratch and now my vegetable garden I've just started doing and um I've thought I've fed the soil very well and done all the right things I'm trying to go sort of organic.

 Good girl where are you in Kurrajong.

 I'm in Cedar Ridge ro.

 Oh I know that very well . I used to live on East Kurrajong Road.

 Oh okay yes. Uh.

 A hard climate up there isn't it. Has it  been raining up there uh this week.

 Oh we've had the most incredible rain  absolutely.

 And the dams filling are they.

 Well the dams all around. As I drive I can hardly look at the road I just  look at all the dams and they actually over so many are overflowing.

 Wonderful news.

 It's I've I've only been up here about eighteen months but it's just amazing.

 It's beautiful I was up there during the drought and it was really depressing and the fires actually that that the fires that Christmas.

 Yeah  well we weren't here for the fires but I'm looking at one of my trees here it's must be about oh thirty metres high and there's it's  black right to the top.

 Yes.

 So.

 Well we lost a couple of houses in my road on that uh on that terrible Christmas. Um but I know a lot of them have been rebuilt and a lot of families starting from scratch but it's such a lovely community up there.

 Oh it is. It's.

 So your organic vegie patch . You're starting from scratch.

 Actually growing in in polys in broccoli boxes 'cos you know what the soil's like  up here so.

 Well the good news uh is up there you can get all of that horse manure.

 Yes I I I get a lot of the stuff and I get sheep manure and everything like that .

 That's what I grew my vegie patch out of when I was up there . Basically completely cor uh well rotted horse manure.

 Okay. Now my problem is I've put in these little lettuce seedlings and they're only probably three inches high and I've only had planted them out about three weeks ago  but they're bolting to  seed.

 That's because.

 What have I done wrong.

 Lettuce is really a cool climate crop.

 Ah.

 Which means that they're much better over autumn and winter than spring and summer. And because we had that really hot weather before we had the rain y'know those  thirty plus days. The sih um really hot weh weather uh induce lettuce to go straight to seed. Very very quickly so it's much better I know it's weird it I always  find the irony . The irony of the situation is that lettuce  you eat in summer in summer  but in fact it's really hard to grow in summer because if it's in a full sun position it will always bolt. Bolt  to seed which I love because it does bolt to seed it just elongates and off you go . So other.

  three inches high.

 Yep exactly  it's so it's uh it's the irony of the gardening world so um.

 Put some shade cloth over it.

 Uh well uh in a shady sp a shadier spot  but it's the heat is going to do it too.

  next to water tank so it's sort of half shade you know so.

 Yeah it I mean lettuce we m I say we dad had the best crop of lettuce and it's just at the end now uh of the uh uh he had uh he had seriously ten different types of lettuce I mean the types of wonderful lettuce you can get these days is just terrific  but I have to say he planted it in in uh winter. And it was the beautiful winter crop right through the cooler months um and now um in the vegie patch we should really be concentrating on all the Mediterranean vegetables uh basically um capsicum eggplant and um tomatoes zucchini and squash are all terrific. Now with the lettuce or the um the leafy vegetables concentrate on rocket. And um the rainbow chard spinach and things like oh y'know all the herbs . 'Cos I make very herby salads in summer because the herbs do quite well. Basil and all of those sorts of things . But get them in now get all those herbs in now because planting them any later into the hot weather into summer and again they'll bolt to seed.

 Yes now I've got all those herbs in I ha I have it all that and I was thinking of trying to have my vegetables y'know all through the summer my own stuff so this has put paid to my theory.

 Yes . Get a good guh um vegetable book I tell you what my absolute oh bible is a book called The Complete Book of Vegetables Herbs and Fruit. Uh it's absolutely wonderful it's Cameron House is the publisher  it's quite a heavy book uh like it probably I call it my bible it's probably as heavy as a bible as well but I tell you what any time I need to know anything it's got everything about every fruit and herb and vegetable in it and such an amazing resource for you and just to let you know certain things about that lettuce not a good um warm uh month crop. S really concentrate on the rockets and the Mediterranean vegetables there Jenny and good luck with it.

 Very ironic that this wonderful summer salad  vegetable  doesn't like growing in summer  but there you.

 Not not in Sydney that's for sure.

 But it's not your fault . Mila good morning.

  good morning.

 Hi Mila.

 Hi how are you.

 Good how are you.

 Yeah I got a problem on my peaches nectarines pree uh previous years I got a good fruit. But last year it's uh when you look outside it's okay but there is some black spots  on the fruit  and when you open it's rotten . So I didn't get even one piece of of fruit.

 Well it's just a seasonal thing I wouldn't worry there's nothing you can do for this year Mila unfortunately sometimes fruit have better years than others and I think yes you've got a fungus and a and a and a rot in the fruit uh I really don't think there's much you can do uh at all this year you know you could next year um water in with uh anti-rot around the tree as a preventative for next year but uh nothing you can do this year unfortunately uh and I I would just fingers crossed that next year's fruit isn't um susceptible to the same rot.

 Thanks for your call Mila we do have to leave it there um we've got Sandra's diary coming up soon and more of your calls are welcome on one-three-one-eight-seven-three you can call through now you're listening to the Garden Clinic on Two G B.



 Yes top of the morning to you nice to have your company Luke Bona here with Linda Ross this morning and some lines are available you  powered through some calls in that last half hour one-three-one-eight-seven-three and Two G B dot com you've got a couple of uh emails here Linda can I read one to you. Um in fact we did touch on this last week but you can uh you can repeat this it's from Manly Vale Elizabeth can pool water salted  be used on the garden ih uh it's nearly overflowing at the moment and instead of wasting it I would like to make use of it.

 Oh depends what you're growing but uh it really depends what you're growing I would worry about certain things uh so no. I would b I would be a little bit worried about this.

 Do you feel guilty when your   when your pool is filled but it's it's also probably a very good opportunity for you to backwash your pool. Uh 'cos you gotta do that occasionally so if you got a it's it's a salt water pool so you've probably got a cartridge. Uh and anyone with a Diatomaceous Earth filter if your pool is full and ih you do feel terribly guilty running that water off but give it a backwash 'n'  and that's the time to do it I su I suppose.

 Thanks Luke. Yes I would very worried a lot of plants hate salt and uh and a lotta plants won't even grow around a salt water pool just because of the splash of the salt water. Okay straight out to Pamela at Normanhurst good morning.

 Good morning to you but um. I learn a lot from your program each uh weekend thank you very much.

 Terrific.

 I've got a lovely bush garden uh surrounded by trees turpentine gums . Uh azaleas and um tree ferns and um  tt yes. And I've been given a stag horn for a birthday present it's very healthy and I want to know how to keep it healthy . And where I should hang it what aspect.

 Well I like to keep my stag horns in morning sun. Uh or dappled shade considering that's where they grow  I mean I have seen up in Dorrigo I go bushwalking um through those mountains and the stag horns up there are just incredible. And they like dappled sun under turpentines or under eucalypts that's where they grow so your environment there at Normanhurst will be perfect a dappled sun just as long as you're not getting any of the hot afternoon sun.

 Yes that's what I was thinking because there are parts of the garden that get the westerly sun.

 Yes. As all gardens . But try not to try to protect it from the hot afternoon sun uh but and I mean I have seen stag horns very healthy stag horns and quite robust in full sun but they have become that way over a long period of time and they've hardened up . Uh but uh young ha stag horns uh th really you know they're th  th the best uh position is dappled shade under trees . And looking after them is  quite easy. They really don't mind just using the rain that falls and whatever falls into their lovely foliage sort of catchment  uh as fertiliser. You can every now and then shoot some seaweed up into them if they're up in a tree  um by clicking onto uh a seaweed uh thing onto the hose and just squirting it  because they do let those lovely foliage  um curved foliage take up the nutrient through the leaf . Um and the only other thing I would m be mindful of is the stag horn or elk horn beetle. That does a lot of damage . Uh and you can see it um eating through the the the big beautiful f um leaf uh foliages uh f with the stag horn beetle and the only thing that really nips that in the bud is using Confidor but I would just be mindful of that. 

 Yes the other thing I have are possums.

 Oh.

 Do possums like stag horn.

 Not really.

 Oh good .

 Possums like other things like roses.

 I'm tried with possums all the time I've had  roses with it with a possum proof fence round them I'm hoping I'm going to get some .

 Well hopefully the r the possum won't go for the stag horn although if the possum's very hungry it probably  will um uh there are uh other plants that possums would prefer  magnolia buds rosebuds .

 Oh you're very encouraging . Thank you very much. Good.

 Thank you Pamela.

  other thing I must tell you which annoys me intensely I have an easement at the bottom of my garden and all this beautiful water going to waste down the drain.

 Yes luh uh I think everyone's sort of well anyone.

  you can do about it.

 There's  I've been listening to the government this week  talking about uh all of their solutions for water in this nation and this c in this beautiful city of ours. And I just think um y'know what all we can do as as home owners and and gardeners is capture as much of the rain that falls in our properties with a rainwater tank and use it on our garden and start at a grassroots level capture the uh s the rain um ih if you wanna divert that water flow ih um into a a a po a pool or something a pond um really um to yuh hook up the the roof uh with a water tank and see if we can capture as much as we can and then use that uh for our gardens I think that's just the easiest most simple idea and to know that that rebate for a rainwater tank has been extended to July two-thousand-and-eight where homeowners get six-hundred-and-fifty dollars rebate uh for installing a rainwater tank now there's so many wun wonderful tanks out there Pamela. Have you thought about that.

 Yes I am thinking about it yes indeed.

 I mean there's so many good dis uh tanks there's just the corrugated iron ones that look they're in a homestead out back  uh there's some slimline g rectangular tanks that actually fit down the side passages of our homes and driveways they're really very uh functional uh the other one I really like is a bladder system which I which operates as a an a a flexible bladder um and you can put it under the house or under a deck. It's Rain Reviver that's the company that does it and that means it's out of the way uh if it's hard y'know if you've got no space around your uh house these systems uh I think are absolutely ingenious and an an Australian invention I was looking up on the web uh last weekend that's Rain Reviver and they operate as big um like pillow shaped packages really that just open and contract and expand as the water goes in and you just flow the water in and then you can use it for whatever you need to the garden or or flushing the toilet or or uh or whatever. Uh uh a really wonderful Australian invention that's a bladder system from Rain Reviver but of course so many t types of rainwater tanks out there for us to choose from.

 Do you know what else there is now. Y you'll love this. If you're constructing a new home  walls and instead of having a concrete wall which is um ma maybe three hundred mils wide it's hollow  and it contains water.

 Using the cavity in the wall.

 How good is that.

 Terrific and I saw another one that the walls of a shed like a  garden shed were about a foot wide and they also were a reservoir for water as well a lot of people uh are using their brains to come up with very lateral ways of capturing water um on our gardens and I think if we can't um go forward uh as um um y'know it has been very o obvious from last week uh I think y'know gardeners can really make the solutions uh in their homes and in their gardens.

 It's a quarter to seven here at Two G B the Garden Clinic now if you lis listen very carefully between now and nine because  we'll be giving away uh thank you very much to um the f the people at Munns Munns quality garden products Australian owned since nineteen-forty-eight we have a golf course green lawn fertiliser five kilo bag two organic garden booster bags they're five kilos each the pack is worth fifty dollars we'll ask our Munns garden question between now and nine stay listening the first correct caller through when we give you a queue to call is today's winner.



 Hello Glad.

 Hello Luke hello Linda.

 Hello hello how are you.

 Fine thank you.

 That's good wha.

 Um my problem is um  tt uh pride of Madeira. It's the first year that I've had it that it's flowered.

 Wonderful how long has it taken to flower for Glad.

 Um well it's probably been in um oh perhaps twelve months.

 Oh well that's very lucky mine took four years to flower.

 Did it oh no  it hasn't been in that long. And uh now it's it's um  y'know it it has flowered and with this rain it's all droopy what do I do with it.

 Prune it back.

 Just prune.

 Prune all those flowerheads off I mean the pride of Madeira is just a favourite of mine for its stunning purple flowers. I mean some of them get about two foot long  and um and of course it's very drought tolerant a very waterwise plant doesn't need much water at all Mediterranean sort of plant  um like the lavenders and oh just stunning. But I would pr ih mine is droopy too um because of course they've got big heads of flowers and when they get wet they droop um just with the weight of the rain in them.

 And would I cut all those spikes.

 You can cut all those spikes back.

 Right  and it's next to a curl tree. Would their root systems.

 No they'll be fine together . Very happy together.

 Oh good.

 Thanks Glad.

 Thank you very much.

 I'm growing the tower of jewels uh pride of Madeira which I have to say maybe mum and dad mentioned it uh is probably three metres high with flower spikes about five foot long um uh unbelievable we're taking a photo and putting it into uh the magazine but it is probably three metres lo it's certainly taller than dad um so at least three metres tall uh and the flower spikes in excess of one metre tall unbelievable tower of jewels it's a a new variety of the pride of Madeira but certainly a big one for the garden let's go straight to Sally good morning.

 Good morning how are you today.

 Excellent how are you.

 Not too bad thank you.

 Good.

 Now before I start on what I wanted I heard you advertising the white cedar which I agree is a beautiful tree.

 Not advertising but just mentioning yes .

 Well mentioning right okay but but please may I warn any of your listeners who are thinking of investing in it that that the caterpillar that you mentioned  is a hairy brute and a lot of children are allergic to it. And it wanders into the house and you're likely to find its pupa uh c uh when it uh pupates before beforming the moth anywhere. And we had a terrible trouble because my nephew was allergic to it.

 Oh dear it can become a problem yes.

 It can be uh but if if they do as you said put the canvass around the thing  and kill them all off every morning  then you can keep the wretches down to control.

 Good . A pretty tree though.

 It's a beautiful tree I agree very pretty. And it's a light foliage it's not one of those very heavy dense.

 That's true.

 So you can grow other things underneath it.

 Exactly.

 And at this time of year you've got the very very pretty flowers but people need to don't put it outside the bedroom door of y bedroom window of your favourite son or you you'll wake him up itching in the middle of the night.

 Oh one for a property maybe.

 Well that's that's right or as ou out the front gate where the it can drop on the passers-by y'know.

 Yeah  a  good street tree.

 Naughty naughty aren't I. Okay now um what I was wanting to know is do you know anything about  pruning paw pawpaw trees.

 No why would you.

 Well I've got two and the um I'm looking out the back window now at the plain ordinary orange one which is five metres tall. And I cannot get the fruit .

 Oh dear.

 The possum's eaten half of half the big one.

 Yep.

 And I'm just going to try and recruit the friend up the street to bring his long ladder down as .

 Yes you need a a a sparky or someone or a chippie with a really long ladder.

 Well yes exactly but I'm just wondering what would happen if I chop it off will it shoot out again.

 It probably will but it's not uh um advisable.

 It's not advisable.

 No uh I mean there are smaller growing pawpaws to grow Sally and you  might like to get.

 It was just it was just from a seed.

 Yes well that's right but there are varieties.

 Mm see um I've got the um bisexual red and it's the same but fortunately it's right beside the garage so we can shin up on it and get .

 That's an im that's a very good thing a good solution plant it near a house or a t or a shed or something but no they're tall trees you can get smaller varieties and if you were looking for the s um named varieties I would definitely go to uh Daleys Fruit Tree Nursery or look them up on the web uh they're just the best Australian uh fruit nursery they do mail order and I'll just give you uh their email address um which is Emma at Daleys fruit dot com dot A U um Daleys spelt D A L E Y S and they specialise in subtropical fruit and nuts uh lots of pawpaws there uh macadamias herbs I mean terrific passion fruit custard apples avocadoes mangoes as well so if you're interested in subtropical fruit Daleys Fruit n Nursery is just wonderful it's at Kyogle but they do mail order and I'm sure they've got a smaller dwarf growing um pawpaw but uh I would not recommend a pruning.

 Three minutes to seven Two G B the Garden Clinic with Linda Ross.



 Good morning and welcome to another Sydney weekend Luke Bona here with Linda Ross and the Garden Clinic after nine as uh the man just said Sydney Real Estate with Mark Moraza and between ten and twelve today it is Your Health with Dr Graham a big line up today but Linda's here one-three-one-eight-seven-three is the telephone number and.

 She'll do in the meantime.

 Listen can I can you quickly um answer this you'll do this in two seconds this is from Michelle  from Harrington Park. .

 Oh. Okay new water. There is a fertiliser a liquid fertiliser Michelle that uh is actually named Lucky Bamboo and it's particularly for the water of the plant now it needs a really light bright spot as you can imagine ih something that's just growing in water needs a lot of uh sunshine to help photosynthesis and and good strong healthy growth. So I would go to my local nursery and I would buy the liquid fertiliser that's for lucky bamboo. They made one particularly for it because of course it's uh it's a soluble thing that's not it doesn't grow in in soil that's my first step um secondly I would put it in a really light bright sunshiny spot in the house so good luck with it I hope it uh  gets a little bit healthier in the next couple of weeks for you. Okay straight to Balgowlah good morning John.

 Good morning. Thanks very much for your show and I'm sure uh all all of your listeners enjoy it.

 Thank you.

 Uh my little problem is concerns a a  Tahitian lime which I put in that's about seven years old now  and uh buh as we're moving I've had to repot it I've pulled it out and it's now in a pot. Uh we've cut it back considerably  and some of the b some of the little branches are starting to die off and some are staying nice and green. Uh will you say what should I do. S s anything I can  help it with at all.

 Well the thing is it's probably in shock. 'Cos you've severed the roots.

 Yeah well that makes two of us.

  And unfortun uh was it a big big tree.

 Oh ih cuh about two metres.

 Yeah see that's quite  la and when was this done John.

 Oh about a month ago.

 Oh okay. Okay so what is what's happening is the tree has exploded into new growth probably like its sap's moving around and then you've come along and cut the roots. So it's just stressed out but what I would do in these situations when I'm transplanting anything out of the garden into a pot into a new spot um spray with Stress Guard. And it is uh um it covers the leaf and it stops the leaf from losing moisture. It basically stops moisture loss from transpiration uh really helpful uh at a time like this . What what it will do is dry out. Because the water uh ih it'll be stressed the roots actually can't take any moisture in and the leaves are giving moisture off so it's uh that's will ench eventually happen it'll dry out and die so the Stress Guard is very very good in this sort of situation when you're transplanting something not in autumn or winter  and uh and as an evergreen um plant of c ih it should be moved in autumn so we're a little bit late  but Stress Guard it. Which is a spray that you can spray over all of the leaves . Um and that stops any moisture being lost and that will help I would've liked that to be have done before you did it but now is still very good you'll get uh you ih will be very useful and just water the roots every week with seaweed solution.

 Uhuh that's the key one thanks very much.

 That's the key.

 Okay doke.

 Both of those now if you wanna hold on there John I'll send you out some Maxicrop  fr um which is a s wonderful seaweed solution uh so if you just hold on there  I'll get your address and we'll send you some Maxicrop because no n uh as well as as um you using the Maxicrop now while it's in a pot when it gets into its new location  it needs to be regularly watered with um s uh Maxicrop as well.

 Is it will it survive in a pot.

 It will survive in a pot a lot of Tahitian limes which I call the gin and tonic tree grow very well in big pots . So yes.

 Yes it's in a big one.

 Is it in a big pot.

 Fairly big yes.

 Something like a um eventually a half wine barrel is a  good size for  a a a Tahitian lime.

 Great.

 Okay . Terrific my pleasure John just remember also that uh citrus need to be fertilised three times a year they're very hungry uh but not for you right now let's wait till it gets a little bit better and it regenerates from it's uh huge shock and anyone else who's got citrus spring winter and autumn. Feed three times a year. Straight to Dorothy good morning Dorothy.

 Oh good morning Linda and Luke.

 Do they call you Dot.

 Y no really I'm a Dorothy Norman .

 Very good.

 She's a Dorothy Dorothy .

 Very good.

 How can we help you.

 I have a buffalo lawn in trouble.

 Yeah.

 Now it gets the sun all in summer all day but in winter about a quarter of it is mostly in shade . But it's always survived . Now this year I've had an absolute mat of weed in this area . I've dug it out but most of the buffalo is dead underneath  and the area seems to be almost rotted.

 Yes. The shade and the um the wi.

  water I suppose.

 That's right. D'y'know what I would think about doing Dorothy I know uh eh uh y'know I'd have liked the garden to be as easy and as trouble free as possible. The quarter is it under a tree that doesn't get the sun.

 No no it's some trees um from next door.

 Trees from next door. I would think about not having lawn there.

 Oh.

 Because it problem is gunna happen  year after year after year. The.

 Well this is the first year it's happened . I get a few weeds but I take them out and I never have any trouble.

 With the um the m harder um environment that we've gotta garden with now with the um the very dry winter we had with the druh well the drought really whether you wanna call it a drought or just y'know no rain  . Na a natural sort of r um climatic condition that we have at the moment the lawn in that area will constantly each year um find it harder and harder to uh grow after the winter.

 What about the shade resistant buffalo.

 Shade tolerant buffalo is a good one  sh called Shademaster. But again complete shade over winter it will struggle to get back. Uh in in it's so hard to get mm a lawn growing in these areas but Shademaster is a terrific one but better in dappled shade obviously not full shade.

 Well it's not full shade.

 Okay . Well Shademaster is a great alternative.

 Now what about this mat of uh it almost looks like um uh well uh I suppose it's rotted dowh lawn and rotted weed. I've tried to scrape it up but it it looks as though it will need something a fungus spray or something on it.

 Well if it sounds like if if it's a whole lot of weeds and a whole loh um it it needs to be replaced.

 Yes I'll have to replace it.

 So maybe you would like to replace it um with the Shademaster uh lawns are it's it's such a hard thing I mean my I've totally relaxed my uh feelings of lawn I have because I am not prepared to water my lawn. Uh with the water restrictions and so it must stand up for itself so dad and I were laughing at it because it's more clover but I have the greenest sh c l I know that will horrify some of you lawn experts out there but it's a quite a green lawn I mow the lawh mow the clo clover and uh the dandelion and it's quite quite fine and uh of course I don't have to water it and it's n really nice and green so sometimes we have to l relax our feelings when it comes to lawn with the drought and uh the water restrictions. But in your case maybe now is time to replace it with a shade tolerant lawn like Shademaster.



 Lucky members for today the twenty-third and Mrs Elizabeth Disney.

 Nora from Dover Heights good morning.

 Hi Luke hi Linda how are you.

 Hello Nora how are you.

 Good thank you.

 Long time no speak.

 Well absolutely except I think Lara rang you  a couple of weeks ago.

 Lara was just adorable.

 Um Linda we put in a jacaranda in a sheltered position.

 Where did you buy it from.

 From a nursery.

 Good yep.

  four years ago  but not one sign of a little purple flower. Now my neighbour tells me you've gotta wait for seven years but I see trees that look smaller than mine  it must be about eight foot now  and and and they've got flowers on them so can I do anything or is it a dud.

 Not really and don't know .

 Oh right dih buy another one.

 Very hard to know  um at the nursery they do um you do buy uh guaranteed to flower plants  now I mean all nurseries should be um gr um selling um plants that are guaranteed to flower . Uh that's just y'know uh absolutely given when you buy a jacaranda. If you had um propagated a jacaranda from seed  I would say yes seven years to flower and maybe never  but because you have bought it from the nursery I'd say ih there's a hundred percent um chance that it will flower.

 Oh uh oh eventually.

 Eventually . And it might take a couple of.

  no idea of the time it.

 Not not really I mean sometimes a a jacaranda takes seven years uh to feel comfortable enough to flower . But um uh and um and sometimes those ones that you see that are flowering young ones.

 Yes.

 They've been in a pot for a long time . So what they think they ac they actually trick themselves into thinking that they're older than they are because their root space is completely taken up with roots . And uh a plant uh oh ov often will fruit and flower when it's in a pot because it feels like it's mature  'cos there's no more space for the roots  to grow.

 Don't chop it down .

 No I I'd give it a couple more years Nora.

 Alright  thanks Linda.

 Thank you.

 Bye.

 Bye-bye and gee I can just see a mauvy tint across the uhs the city this week as the jacarandas are just about to burst into flower absolutely my favourite time of the year because it coincides with my birthday ha ha but if you'd like to join us on the jacaranda cruise you can we've got three beautiful cruises to celebrate jacarandas and Sydney um ring nine-four-eight-four-five-one-hundred if you wanna join the Ross family on the harbour for three hours stuff yourself with uh muffins and have a cup of tea with us that's coming up in November. Straight to Baulkham Hills Dorothy good morning.

 Um this is the first time I've ever rung  I listen every weekend.

 Thank you for listening  Dorothy. 

 Having problems with my b well I'm not problems with my blue potato vine.

 Oh wonderful thing to grow we don't really talk about it much.

 No this is why I've been listening to see if someone else has .

 I'm glad  you've plucked up the courage to ring.

 Last year it was absolutely this was its first year it was perfect I had beautiful clumps of blue flowers.

 Mhm.

 And followed by the.

 Berry.

 Berries and they were magnificent. But now I let it go in the winter time because I didn't know what to do about it and now I'm wondering should I be pruning it or should I.

 When did it flower for you.

 Um.

 Autumn.

 No  not theh not this year it must have been  uh earlier on much earlier on.

 Uh summer this year.

 Mm yes it would've been summer.

 Oh okay um what could it be uh they do flower summer and autumn  and then that's wh as soon as they finish flowering Dorothy that's when to prune them.

 And how how far do you .

 Well you can you can be as tough as you like really.

 Yes well it it looks scraggly at the moment.

 Exactly.

 And I thought now should I.

 I wouldn't prune it now . It's too late for this year . Uh and uh that's fine blue potato vine and 'n' Solanums often get straggly. Uh that's just their nature they're looking for the sun and they're straggly and leggy and.

 Well it gets plenty of sun.

 Yeah that's why it's looking for the sun it goes out and it lengthens. Uh that's the a little bit of an issue when when growing potato vines but when it stops flowering um in s autumn summer and autumn next year two-thousand-and-five then you can prune quite hard.

 And do I feed it now or.

 Um definitely feed it now spring is a wonderful time to feed Dorothy and really whatever you've got will be right for a potato vine whether it's Organic Life or Garden Gold anything for a potato vine now and that will encourage more flowers and then a really hard prune after flowering.

 Dorothy thank you for your call we do have to move on twenty-seven past seven Two G B.



 Yes Luke and Linda this morning in the Garden Clinic and we're still waiting for Mrs E Mansfield from Mt Warrigal Miss Tamara Barinov from Woollahra Miss uh Mrs Thelma Hayes from Redfern we've heard from Elizabeth Disney and Lee Zorbis so they're our final three members on the Garden Clinic please call us on one-three-hundred-seven-double-two-eight-seven-three and pick up your prize which is some Yates Pest Oil. But remember you can also contact the Garden Clinic today. The office is open today 'n' you can join the Garden Clinic uh and Linda your telephone number there.

 And  nine-four-eight-four-five-one-hundred thank you so much for joining us here on the Garden Clinic show uh Linda and Luke with you uh lovely to have your company on a warm Saturday love the weekend I love when it rolls around oh we can just take a load off make a nice cup of calming tea and look out to the lovely garden see how it's spruced up with the recent spring rains. I hope your garden's looking a treat let's go out to Laurie Kirrawee and see what her garden's looking like.

 Oh  water-shod . But I'm so glad to see the sun.

 Fr it's good isn't it . How can how can we help what are you doing today.

 Well uh I have a Christmas bush uh at the moment it's in full white bloom. It's in a pot about oh.

 A n a New South Wales Christmas bush.

 Yes.

 Yep  not the New Zealand yep.

  yeah ih it's the one that turns  red after  it's in a pot about fourteen inches across . I want to put it out into the garden but the only problem is uh the soil is quite clay . Now can I successfully leave it in the pot  uh oh I'd rather I mean it's about a a metre and a half tall . A and I I would like to get it out into the garden  but I don't quite know how to go about it.

 Well let me just firstly say if you put it in the garden now it will die . The clay soil it hates clay soil.

 Oh I know.

 So you've got to um build up the soil into a mound with really good compost and soil and um uh a bit of a proportion of sand because you can see where the New South Wales Christmas bush grow they grow right along the Hawkesbury sandstone areas where the soils is quite skeletal but quite well drained.

 Yeah well it came from uh my son's garden in Frenchs Forest.

 Yeah perfect there you go  exactly. That's the perfect spot for it Frenchs Forest the soils are so well drained there so what you've gotta do is replicate that . Mound up the soil so the water drains away. Put a lot of cow manure to m to break down that clay use Clay Breaker and GroundBreaker or gr uh GroundBreaker which breaks down the clay for you . And even if you want import a little bih uh I normally say don't import topsoil make it yourself but with really heavy clay uh import topsoil uh uh into a mound  um so you've got a nice mounded garden bed plant the Christmas bush at the top and you can put other things like kangaroo paw or whatever you wish around it .

 Well 'cos the place where I'm going to put it uh I've had a several mm uh layers of uh sugarcane mulch  over the years ih in that garden 'cos it's where I have all my bulbs as well . A and uh uh like uh that can be dug in I've found that that t tended to mat a bit on top of the soil.

 It does mat . Um like any mulch does um but yes you can build that in hmhm  um but just try and raise the garden bed as much as possible Laurie  because if water collects at the root system it will rot in y'know five seconds flat.

 Yeah well I don't want to lose it . Uh how long could I leave it in the pot that it's in.

 How long .

  it's about two year old.

 See and it's flowering well.

 Oh ih it's covered in flower.

 Wonderful well then I would probably just leave it there until the area um is at to your satisfaction . Till the soil is friable and well drained enough for you to think it's gunna grow and the water will drain away . That's that's when.

 Have I got uh t time for just another quick.

 Yeah.

 Uh I have an apricot tree. I grew it from seed uh and it's about three year old. Now for the first two years it did produce fruit but this year uh I've only got about two or three  apricots on it. Would that be because of the drought.

 Exactly.

 Mhm.

 Yeah it's just a little s water stress like so many of the other fruit trees we're getting a lot of problems with fruit trees when they're stressed fruit trees just uh either are susceptible to a lot of insect to rot uh and disease uh and uh when uh they're water stressed particularly that's ih that's evident and they oh often don't fruit so that's all it is Laurie. If your apricot which I think is amazing that firstly you've germinated from seed and secondly that it fruited for you in the first three years is incredible let's just have a little hiatus this year and uh just feed it well at the moment y'know some fruit tree fertiliser and let's wait uh for it to fruit next year lovely to talk to you though and good to get that New South Wales Christmas bush in as soon as you can as soon as you've improved that soil. Uh let's go to Oatlands and speak with Nicky.

 Good morning good morning to you both.

 How are you.

 Not too bad thank you.

 Excellent.

 Um just calling about my lawn it is buffalo it's not a huge area it's it's a really quite a large court yeahr court y'know area  I suppose you could say. Uh north facing. The lawn is in great condition but we have a lot of weeds mainly binh bindy  and and and also this other oh I it's a green on top and it's like silver underneath and I'm digging those out like there's no tomorrow but  yeah they just keep coming back so I just wanted y'know .

 Well you've got a broad leaf grass  which means you can't use any of the weedicides on it.

 That's r yeah that's my problem.

 But I mean having said that a buffalo's the best lawn to have anyway  it's so easy. And looks good most of year . Um so I'd definitely get some Bindii onto the bindy . Um it's a little bit late because they're actually forming um now but uh a little bit of Bindii will help  um and y'know all you can do really is either dig it out by hand  which I always find the best way because you get the root system  and it's all gone and you can just y'know get your little knee pad out there take the t the radio and  off you go um and you know that they're all gone and then give you a fertil um then you give your lawn a little bit of a a feed to m make it all knit into the holes again . Uh a good healthy lawn will um be so thick that weeds find it hard to get in and.

 I have noticed that lately actually  that.

 But then lately I mean goodness luh mm goodness me it's a lawn  it's very y'know we've got water restrictions  we can't keep watering our lawns  y'know that's just fact um so a f if a few little weeds get in l like you've got get them out with a little wuh um hand weeder  or use um a specialised herbicide like uh Roundup or Zero. A.

 Yeah the only thing is have a little one who's just nearly two .

 Well I wouldn't use that either then  uh and dogs as well I would just hand weed  get out there um spend half a day get get them all out and particularly the bindi-eye with her around  you know you wanna get rid of that on uh as as soon as possible but un unfortunately there's no magic solution I wish there was . I wish I would sell it   um but unfortunately I can't it's just a a matter of hand weeding getting them all out and unfortunately it's a little bit of y'know a process that will go on and on as weed seeds blow in  from neighbours and so forth it's really hard to protect our lawn against weeds . But a healthy lawn um thick and healthy  uh and uh now is the time to feed them of course  um really helps because if it's thick lawn the weed seeds find it hard to uh penetrate  and to grow.

 Yep no that's great thanks very much for your help.

 Thank you.

 Thank you bye.

 Bye-bye.

 Thirteen to eight here at Two G B we'll take a break coming back with more of the Garden Clinic more of your calls lawn tips around the corner  and uh I got a couple of emails here that you might want to address I'll let you look at them during the break Linda  this is Two G B.



 Well lawns are growing at a hectic pace aren't they huh hard to get um hard to get them trimmed uh my lawn is oh up to my knees  already. It's the worst um it's it's the tallest lawn in in the whole neighbourhood uh I'm sure people hate my lawn but when you are mowing and I as I am this afternoon yeah just keep it a little bit higher um with the um uh with the less rain we're getting it's important just to have a a little bit higher lawn about two inches three inches l um high uh and that will really help protect it and of course if you mulch mow um that's really important too to mulch the lawn as you go 'n' and that really helps conserve root moisture uh so just a couple of tips there when you're mowing your lawn.

 Good on you Linda let's get back to calls Maurice good morning.

 Good morning .

 Hello Maurice.

 How are you.

 Good how are you.

 Oh not bad.

 How can I help.

 Look I've got a mango tree about fifteen years old.

 Yes.

 And two year ago I had a lot of mango . Last year I didn't have one even. But now there's a lot of flower on it do you think I should spray it with something or.

 No I think you should just leave it unfortunately now it's rained. And that's a loh uh that's a problem um when uh the weather is rainy you ih um sometimes it washes all the pollen away.

 Ah yes.

 That's the problem with m m passion fruits too if anyone's growing passion fruits  because we've had the uh autumn uh sorry the October rains  which month am I in October rains um you you do need to hand pollinate with a small brush f um that's the passion fruit but all I would do for you m Morrie is really just see how that mango goes I mean it's hard to pollinate a tree uh 'cos they're too tall um but yeah.

 .

 Sorry w what was that.

 It's a big tree .

 Big tree that's right yes and you can't really do anything to increase your production and it's unfortunately um with the season that's we have  sometimes it rains when the um the the mangoes are pollinating the the rain washes the pollen away so you don't get the the flowers pollinated and that turning into fruit unfortunately the the climate can be against you so we can just cross our fingers and hope that your flowers have already pollinated themselves before we got the rain from last week.

 So just leave it alone Maurice that's the uh advice from Linda let's move on then there's Robin from Londonderry.

 Hi.

 Good morning.

 Hello.

 Linda good morning Luke how are you.

 We're good thanks.

 I'm ringing this morning about my roses  my climbing roses but before I start can I just quickly say something about those beautiful white cedar trees.

 Yes.

 Which I have some in my driveway and.

 Have you.

 I have one in the house. But I was given them under the name of a cape lilac.

 Really.

 Which I thought that was lovely   flowers are so beautiful however why I'm ringing is  I've learned during a a course at TAFE actually that these um berries are so toxic to horses  they'll kill them within twenty-four hours.

 Yes that's a real problem.

 And I just thought that maybe everybody might like to know that so that if they are planting then uh luckily I didn't plant them in the horse paddock.

 Oh 'cos you're out that way.

  could have been disastrous.

 Horses and cattle uh they're very toxic to  um but you them um they're perfect for a street tree whe .

 Oh look they're the most beautiful canopy .

 But yes that's right they are toxic.

  so wonderful . But to get onto my roses  I have climbing roses on the front fence those white cherokee roses which  have got terribly um  y'know straggly  especially with the drought and y'know not having too much to to give them up there on the street but  I want to know um somebody said I shouldn't cut them back till after they flower and they're only just starting to look like wanting to flower now . Is it right that I leave it till after they  flower  and how far how hard can .

 Oh Robyn you can be ruthless.

 Okay .

 When the kids are annoying you get out there with the secateurs and  take all your anger out on the climbing rose. Now the thing with climbing roses and uh I was at a wonderful garden gee it was pretty. Helen's garden um I duh guh uh landscape design consultation in Pymble last week  and she had this climbing rose and it was a couple of years old and it was a tangled mess and I said give me the secateurs and we untangled it we were very ruthless with it Robyn  um anything that we didn't want we removed . Um a lot of laterals we removed and we then um untangled these this this sort of wild mess of of stems.

 Well that's how mine have got on the  on street line .

 Right and then we just.

 Want them to be y'know cover you from the street a little bit  however they get to the point where they're not .

 That's right and what you want to do after flowering is prune all those laterals back to your framework. And it's so important to uh get that frame work up and running so it looks good it's um w we had uh a some posts of the pergola we were winding them up in a sort of clockwork uh clockwise direction they just looked good in so good in in the end but that's what you need to do prune back the laterals to your framework and then you'll get wonderful new growth and new flowers next year.

 Have to leave it there Robyn thank you for your call and thanks for the warning about those bushes and the b and the and the horses very good advice. Four minutes to eight this is Two G B.



 Luke and Linda this morning um back to you callers in just a second there is an email there that um ih it's a er a problem with a swimming pool and cocos time I believe.

 It is Luke thank you very much for passing this over she has got rid of the cocos palms around her pool yay and uh she'd like some uh replacements something with a little bit of fragrance um.

 Don't you just hate cocos palms  I've got those four hideous ones outside they drop those y yellow berries  in any wind  the pa the palms come down.

 Yeah and then their fronds hang bluh uh like dead because they don't drop the fronds.

 Why did we go through this cocos palm.

 It was some crazy nurseryman and I feel like hunting him down . But  uh from the seventies but he's probably gone now  God rest his soul. But no y'know what  palms are quite lovely and the bangalow palm is a very pretty self cleaning palm. Stop laughing. Um m the bangalow palm it's an Australian palm and it's just beautiful they do get taller and I'm not suggesting you replace uh the cocos with bangalows but in an in a sort of a tropical setting bangalow palms do grow quite well and they're a good b uh palm for cooler climates so if you're out um out in the western suburbs and you want to create that tropical sort of a feel uh bangalow palms are definitely the one for you and in cooler weather they sort of get s a bit stunted so they don't grow as quickly. They're really lovely a s a lovely clean trunk the fronds drop off um they're not big fronds so don't worry it's not gunna hurt anyone but they drop off when they die so they're nice and clean uh and lovely uh and look after themselves. Uh okay so now let's get back Marilyn's qu query. Marilyn it just I just want to know really what height you want these things around the salt water pool. Uh you um if you wanted um taller things around the salt water pool um like a a medium sized tree then an evergreen uh native frangipani would be great uh I just don't know what height you want I mean gardenias are terrific on on a lower level the perfume of a gardenia um in a medium level like a two to three metre level the Magnolia grandiflora little gem. In a sunny spot it just flowers nonstop for ten months of the year and its big white flowers have a a lemon fragrance. Uh that's beautiful uh now uh and if you wanted something taller the native frangipanis a hymenosporum. They're flowering their little heads off at the moment. You'll see them all around Sydney they've got lemon yellow flowers they're a small to medium size tree but quite a fine looking tree not a dense tree so it won't throw a lot of shade and just p oh just a profusion of uh lemon uh flowers right now with a beautiful fragrance. Uh just lovely and a really glossy green leaf too which goes with that tropical sorta look. So I hope that helps and if you um would like to be more specific with the height I'll hih uh I'll help you even further.

 Eleven past eight let's go back to calls Anne from Blacktown good morning.



 Thanks Anne for your call. To Winifred good morning.

 Good morning.

 Hi Winifred.

 Hi thank you I'm an avid fan of the Rosses.

  Thank you darling.

 I enjoy you all. Tell me uh I'm ringing for my daughter she's in Bellevue Hill and her face ow uh house is facing north  and the frontage is a wide long frontage and she's got two will have two wide brick spaces now in that she wishes to put shrubs smaller ones in one lot and taller in the other . I'm very fond of uh oh camellias and gardenias but what do you suggest.

 Well camellias and gardenias are terrific plants and in a northerly position that she has there I would love to see what sort of house she has. Uh a photo would be terrific and then I would be able to maybe suggest things that would bring out the colour of the house or would suit the  style of the house.

 Stone mostly.

 Stone.

 And there will be stone colour.

 And a stone colour so like that ochry colour.

 Yeah.

 Well y'know and uh.

  storeys.

 Two storeys  and uh so I mean the camellias are terrific um particularly the sasanquas as you know fr Winifred would like the  hot sun. Now um gardenias um would be good as well as long as they're not getting any of the western sun.

 No it she's facing north.

 But then accent  plants too would be great.

 Which ones.

 Accent plants plants with strappy leaves like Cordyline red sensation. These are terrific they make great statements and they give a really lovely sort of accent in the garden they really draw your attention because a good garden design should have lots of different textures and leaf shapes. That's what makes it interesting so you've got the small leaf shape of the camellias and then a really interesting strappy leaf shape of a Cordyline red sensation. Or there's a new one called pink sensation now red sensation has burgundy coloured leaves really great looking thing. Tough and hardy and I love it when I plant it with flapjacks underneath because the flapjacks have a burgundy margin to the leaf which picks it up really well and sometimes I like planting it with agaves as well so you get this really good little feel. What are you looking at me like that for you think I'm on a r tangent a raving and ranting but that's what we need to do when we're designing gardens from scratch is get into a little bit of a r rave work out what colours uh and match the colours with other things use foliage plants as well as flowering plants and then you'll have a sensational garden so I would suggest Winifred for her to look at the Cordyline red sensation for her to look at uh flapjacks uh and agaves which are those century plants wonderful statements and then maybe the hedge of Camellia sasanqua at the back.

 Thank you for your call. You shuh you you were getting worked up.

 Oh well a new garden's always exciting isn't it.

 And we've got some garden news with Rodian right  after this.

 Absolutely.



 Well all bush gardeners all fern lovers and all lovers of Australian plants listen up there's been a new discovery in Queensland very interesting and to tell us a little bit more about it Rodian Booker from the Garden Clinic good morning.

 Good morning Linda how you going.

 I'm not too bad rolling through the morning. Tell us about what they found in and Queensland and and what that means for home gardeners.

 Well it's a um a variety of um tassel fern blue tassel fern uh Huperzia. It's a.

 A what . A.

 Huperzia.

 Huperzia mhm.

 Yeah um  often sold as a hanging basket plant or other varieties of it have been makes a stunning um specimen for the shade house and under trees. But they've found one in Queensland that was last recorded in the wild about twenty-six years ago. And it was thought to be extinct.

 Unbelie and where in Queensland.

 Uh location's being kept a secret at the moment .

 Oh it's a bit like the Wollemi pine.

 Very similar yeah. Yeah it's quite a significant discovery because um they've found that an extract of the plant was um useful in treating um or improving cognitive thought process. More efficiently than current supplements like ginkgo and that sort of thing.

 Good 'n' that I wuh I'd love a bit of that.

 Rodian  are you  uh Rodian uh Rodian are you near another telephone. There's a bit of interference there.

 Uh no I'm not actually.

 Anyway keep going  that's bett that's better.

 Now why do they call it blue Rodian.

 Um it's got a slight glaucous uh sorta coating on the foliage. Uh and the r and the rest of the genus is quite a bright um healthy looking green.

 W oh wow so this is different to the and it's a blue tassel fern now when do they think I mean obviously a new discovery hasn't been seen for a while thought to be extinct when do they think it will be available for home gardeners. I wanna get  me some.

 Well the um pharmaceutical benefit should ensure that the propagation gets  underway as soon as possible uh and they're hoping to get it out into garden centres I'd imagine within a couple of years. But they're not a speedy plant to grow and so not the easiest to propagate so  it could take some time.

 Extracting the pharmaceutical benefits would be hard I mean w uh would it be available in a capsule form or or uh. Is it the  is it the foliage  that has it.

 There is one species in the genus that comes from China the plants come from sort of  um all over Asia and we've got nine species here including the blue one. Um the one from China is being s there's a capsule at the moment. But they've under undergoing trials to  um our native varieties are  uh as beneficial.

 So more effective than than than uh ginkgo huh I need.

  ginkgo  how do you know.

 I need to improve my memory well thank you for that it's always wonderful I think to hear of uh an Australian new discovery there's um like the the Wollemi pine we just get so excited when we know that there's things that are out there that haven't been touched and to know that it has pharmaceutical benefits like so many of the plants around the world that haven't been found we just don't know what we've got until someone goes out and finds it for us so thank you very much.

 There he goes Rodian thank you for that have a good day.

 With the blue tassel fern very interesting more potent than the ginkgo biloba good for memory I'll certainly be looking out for that one.



 Noel good morning. Noel.

 Hi Noel.

 Hello.

 How are you.

 Good thanks.

 That's good.

 Good Luke is it.

 It's Luke yes and how's your memory.

   Now I've got a proper one for you.

 Oh right what.

 Now this belongs to the uh bird of paradise plant. And it's called  all I can find out is nickname  uh sexy Lynne.

 .

  I knew it. I knew it.

  Are you serious.

 No I am that's all I can find out about it but it's a beautiful flower. I've seen it.

 Is it pink.

 Sorta p uh pink and white I think it was.

 Yeah.

 It was about twelve months or so it's turned and I've been trying to find out everywhere where do you get them.

 Well d'y'know what I think it is. I think it's a h um oh duh duh duh I think it's a crab's claw a heh Heliconia.

 A what.

 A Heliconia.

 Uh now hulih.

 Hih huh lu okay Heliconia um heh uh H E L.

 H E L.

 E  C O  E C O I N uh.

 Too fast for me.

 Right  H E L E C.

 S C.

 E C.

 E C.

 O N.

 O N.

 I A.

 I A.

 I A and it's Heliconia  um does the l did the flower drop down.

 Yeah.

 Okay now the this is sexy pink is uh also it's another name I'm very happy th to know that it's called sexy Lynne . That makes me  quite a a happy yeah sexy pink it it's also known  in the florist industry. Now a lot of florists um use it and they sell it about twenty dollars for a a a  flower stem . It is a tropical plant Noel so it is very difficult to grow in Sydney. It I have seen it growing in gardens in Cairns and Darwin um when I do our Cairns our north uh north Queensland tropical duh tour we see it in gardens all over the shop it's a Heliconia ih very closely related as you say to the birds of paradise. Um thah ih sometimes they call them crab's claws now you can grow a couple of Heliconias in Sydney my friend Robyn has one called Heliconia rostrata which is a red flowering Heliconia crab's claw in a very hot um sunny courtyard with the western sun and reflected heat from the surrounding walls that's the sort of microclimate you need Noel to find it now you're not gunna find it for sale in Sydney you might find it for sale in mel um Brisbane. Uh so let's have a lookout and see if we've can find it we can do a little search in the nurseries in Brisbane but unfortunately uh it's a little bit too south here in Sydney to grow the Heliconia sexy Lynne or sexy pink but thanks for bringing it to our attention Noel and uh hope you have a wonderful weekend in the garden.



 One-three-one-eight-seven-three is the telephone number straight back to calls in the Garden Clinic Nicky good morning.

 Yeah hi um guys thanks very much for your program it's great.

 Thanks for ringing in Nicky.

 That's okay um I've got a question we laid um some sir Walter turf just before the heat wave.

 Yep.

 It was looking rather dodgy so we Seasoled it a couple of times. And then we had all the rain. And then  because we'd had some sewerage pipework done in February we ended up with a trench right down the middle of our turf.

 Buh yeah.

 So we've had to repair it we repaired it yesterday but what I was wondering was should I Seasol it again uh we have got a watering permit and should I start watering it again even though we've had all that rain.

 No.

 No.

 Oh  yes.   no yes how  what  if y h you had to t take it out and then put it in.

 We had to roll the turf back  over the trench.

 Oh yes  water water with the seaweed.

 Water so today.

 Yep  even though it's rained  um the roots will be um will have sort of broken up a little bit and they  do need to uh to be repaired  and the best way to repair roots is with the seaweed solution so just water in that strip the seaweed and get all those roots to knit back together . Uh and that will happen very quickly particularly in this weather Nicky.

 Okay so um what's the difference between that Charlie Carp and the Seasol.

 Well um in well Charlie Carp's not seaweed.

 Oh isn't it . Oh that's the fish stuff.

 It's just mushed up  Charlie carps  from the rivers which is great all for all um plants really and uh the whole garden but really the seaweed is what you need  because that's what's g uh the vitamins and the minerals in it  that will help something um you sorta just get back into health after being uh shocked and  sort of m.

 Yeah it's a tonic for plants.

 That's it.

 .

 That you're a good girl . I might send you some . How about I send you some.

 Oh that'd be great.

 I'll send you some Maxicrop um to help you but how um it will take a couple of weeks to get to you Nicky  but um it will help in the long term and just uh y'know gyee uh water that strip in and get that to knit knit back together. Uh hold on the line we'll send you back to Daisy we'll get your uh address and we'll send you some more Maxicrop out. A good seaweed solution that one.

 Good on ya Nicky stay right there it's nineteen minutes to nine we'll take another call in just a second but it is prize time. Now earlier in the program we spoke to Rodian about something rather special. And rather secret.

 We did and it was just found in deepest darkest Queensland we don't know what  or we don't know ooh we do know what  and that's the question but we don't know where uh what was uh the little plant that has been rediscovered hasn't been seen for twenty-eight years and it has very interesting cognitive memory um uh.

 Benefits.

 Benefits.

 One th I  I just I just thought I'd remind you there. One-three-hundred-s . You ih you need some one-three-hundred-seven-double that was perfect one-three-hundred-seven-double-two-eight-seven-three is the number and  the first caller through has won the Munns bag it's a it's a golf course green lawn fertiliser five kilo bag.

 I tell you who needs that.

 Two organic garden booster kih five kilo bags and the pack is worth fifty dollars thanks to Munns quality garden products Australian owned since nineteen-forty-eight.

 Mark Mark Moraza needs that.

 He why.

 He just y'know he got ih he just he just arrived and he's upset at me . Because I was bagging lawn lovers and saying you know just relax with the lawn he's saying you can't relax with your lawn. He's so uptight about the lawn he feeds it nearly every week . He goes all of guys love their lawn so don't bag .

 And we mow it and we mow it in a pattern.

 It it oh   you've got your special way of mowing have you boys.

 You have your special way you do y w your pattern and you leave us alone.

 And then he asked me why would he bother with an organic lawn food. Because he just wants a green lawn he doesn't really care and I said well y'know y you have to worry about the the waterways and our river systems and he goes I don't care and then I thought y'know what I'm gunna put it differently. 'Cos he's out on his boat and he wants to catch a fish I said well y'know what  if you use an organic food you'll be able c catch more fish on that lovely boat of yours and that's I think actually changed his mind.

 He has enough trouble ry not running it into rocks let alone  catching fish eighte I I've been there eighteen to nine hi Anita.

 Hello good morning.

 Hello.

 I have a terrible problem.

 Oh dear.

 Um I had planted my olive trees about a year ago. Yeah sorta about a year ago and they just come up beautiful had all new growth.

 Mhm. What's happened to them.

 All the new growth died off it's looks like somebody went over with it uh with a  weed killer . All my olive trees are it's just frightening. Now.

 When was this.

  maybe it was that really hot day and then  really cold. I dunno.

 Well why don't you just give them a little tip prune.

 A tip prune.

 Tip prune a little light prune all over uh and uh it might've been that very hot day we had last week or the week before uh temperatures uh particularly out at Toongabbie oh remember how hot it was. It was like thirty-five  thirty-eight-point-two thank you Luke. S trust you to remember such an interesting piece of trivia yeah so uh that would've been it ol um uh I was just about to call you Olive Anita those olive trees just coming into the spring season got a little bit burnt just tip prune it water with the seaweed solution and let's geh uh encourage a little bit more growth um with those olives and you can even feed at this time too spring is a good time to feed olive trees and don't worry at all it would've just been a little response to that hot day.

 Thank you for your call sixteen to nine Two G B.



 fish markets. Lorraine good morning.

 Hello. Um hi Luke  look I hah I live at Rouse Hill I have been given a lilac tree.

 Yes.

 And I'm not sure quite how big it grows like where could I plant it. We get a lot of uh westerly sun.

 Yeah okay well the lilacs probably won't like the westerly sun and they really do need the the cold climate . So uh um I mean suh just plant it um in a sunny spot.

 Yeah.

 Um perhaps uh a little bit shaded by the westerly sun it grows to about two six foot two metres tall  and um not a very thick tree but uh and particularly not in um around Sydney. Um but it it will grow it's m a very cold climate thing Lorraine but it will grow there's a good article on how to grow lilac in this y um this spring edition of the Garden Clinic magazine uh how to grow lilac uh which is great written by Sandra. But yeah two metres high plant it in an area that's um a little bit shaded from the westerly sun and off you go 'n' well rotted well good good soils. Nutritious soils and good drainage of course.

 Could you put it in a uh in a large pot.

 Well you could. Better in the ground.

 Better in the ground.

 Yeah 'cos it just gets too hot in a pot the the the  it's the cold climate thing and the roots will get too hot and it probably won't like it so much when it's in the ground of course its roots tend to be much cooler.

 Okay.

 Thanks  for your call.

 Thank you bye.

 I just got an email from Marie. Uh and she says oh I need some help with my lemon tree it's infested with citrus gall wasp uh so yes uh have a look out for that lumpy growth everyone uh on young leaf stems and midribs uh and even the fruit stalks of citrus tree it's cau um caused by citrus uh gall wasp. Uh and most citrus are attacked but grapefruit and rough lemons are the more most susceptible and and of course Marie's got it on her lemon. You do need to remove all the stems that have that affected um w uh gall uh unsightly gall g um growing and repeated attacks can weaken the tree and then of course they're uh unproductive so remove all the galls buh um from the trees place the galls in a plastic bag seal the bag and put it in the garbage. Don't put it in the compost um because you'll just spread it all around so yes try and get on to that as soon as possible and I I would do it this weekend.

 Judy good morning.

 Yes hi.

 Hi Judy . Where are you.

  sorry I had the phone on loudspeaker I was mopping the floors whilst I was waiting . Trying to make the most of my Saturday morning.

 Multitasking that's what I like in a girl.

 That's right. Um look my problem is my puppy. I adore him but  he's a dog that eats absolutely everything . Um he's a jack russell he destroys my camellias 'cos he loves their roots and he loves to eat them he eats the dynamic lifter   even digs into the ground and eats it and he's survived it of all things. But I have bindy all though my grass and I have been hand weeding it  but it just takes so long 'cos I think I have every weed   possible in my lawn um and it's taking so long and the one thing I can put up with everything apart from the bindi-eye.

 Yes I can too ah  again nothing really uh that is safe I would just ue uh unless you wanna s spray with Bindii and keep him off it for a a week which is  sometimes difficult but yeah probably a weekend or uh or a week um I'd say y'know five days keep him off. Uh you could use the Bindii or again.

 Would a weekend be sorry for interrupting would a weekend be sufficient  'cos it means I've actually gotta board him.

 I know. Um there's no real answer for that one I mean as long as possible Judy is all I can say.

 Okay.

 Um and the yeah uh otherwise just keep with the hand weeding just keep him off as long as possible . And obviously do it on a hot day if you can and as soon as possible because they're growing at a at a great rate.

  . 'N' can I slip in one other thing.

 Yep.

 At the moment he's actually sitting on top of my parsley and my um strawberries and my mint.

 How old is he.

 Oh he's nine months and he  sits on top of it and he eats my strawberries. And he eats the chives . Is there anything to discourage them. Or is there anything I could plant with them that .

 No a big smack and .

 And he's just chomped into anoth he's another beautiful .

 When I had my two puppies my two cattle dogs they got into a lot of trouble Judy  uh and they had big smacks on their rear ends and uh and also I had a lot of uh I did put a bamboo fencing all around my garden I made this bamboo from lengths of bamboo and I just stuck them all in it didn't have to be that high because young puppies y'know they don't really jump that m high when they're young but I did use bamboo and I fenced all my garden beds particularly my vegie patch and my herbs. And I just made a little gate I wired it all up myself it took a weekend but ih in the end it dog-proofed my garden. Uh I trained the dogs after a while and they are impeccably trained now. Uh they won't even go into the garden they won't even walk into the garden they're just such good dogs it does take a while it does take that th fen to to build the fence so they know where they're allowed and where they're not. Uh and th that's what I did and uh and then just a little smack every time they go in or a squirt with water as Dr Harry says when they're doing something naughty a little squirt with water in their face.

 Thanks for your call Judy we do have to move awa uh along it's eight minutes to nine back with more calls in just a sec.



 Maureen good morning.

 Yes good morning.

 Hello Maureen.

 Hi um my husband put manure down on the lawn oh about it's been down for a week . Wondering whether it's okay to mow or should you wait until the rain's finished.

 Oh well I think the rain's finished now and the rain will have taken all of that cow manure deep in to the roots so yes I would say it was fine to mow today.

 Fine to go . And could you quickly I need the garden sp the garlic spray that you use.

 Oh just a couple of cloves of garlic it's really easy Maureen a couple  of cloves of garlic all m mashed up buh with the back of a knife or something or um put some hot water in.

 Yeah I just know I guh I know what to do I just need the measurements .  you're in a hurry.

 Oh well the it's just ih there's no real measurements you can just dilute that with  um one to ten  ih with normal water and  spr off you go.

 And soak it for the night.

 Theh uh uh uh save it for the night darling absolutely.

 Thank you so much.

 My pleasure thanks  for ringing.

 Bye.

 Bye-bye.

Ends 1:18:39"
" Good morning everyone and welcome to a very foggy sort of an overca a very  very sort of strange day outside weatherwise isn't it. It's a bit murky. Good morning Mark Moraza from R P Data.

 Yes good morning Luke.

 Well you've just driven in what is it like out there.

 Well it's freezing outside and I was I was I've just been in Cairns I came back last night  from Cairns it's thirty degrees up there so it was  cold.

 You and Graham at a convention or something were you.

 Well yes I saw his uh I saw his signs up everywhere I was I was shoulda probably stayed back and he could just pass me the phone and I'd be back on.

 Yeah you shoulda yeah. You shoulda said here give me the phone now I'll I'll  I'll do the show from Cairns. Eight minutes past nine Mark Moraza is from R P Data Property dot com dot A U. We'll tell you about a fantastic service that his business uh offers the public in just a little while. Uh big uh real estate segment in the Daily Telegraph today uh big What Is Your Home Worth segment obviously they've cottoned on to the fact that  people like to know what their places are worth if they're looking at buying or selling that's what we do here every Saturday morning between nine and ten.

 That's what we've been doing for the last couple of years  yes it'll take a very brave um forecasters . I I think you can take their advice with a grain of salt because forecasters probably two or three years ago said that's it. The market has topped out. It's as high as we're gunna get. This is it you should sell the uh the big time diveh uh investors in the city were saying sell out of the the city sell out of the the city. Two and a half years down the track those people would have lost an awful lot of money because the price growth in the past two years has been massive. Therefore  forecasters right now are just saying oh look it's we're in free fall it's market's crashing 'n' so forth look I I don't believe it. There has been a an adjustment. That adjustment in certain different suburbs has been greater than others. The difficulty with statistics and and this is what I look at all the time the difficulty there is  at the end of the day and there's uh I think there's a highlight of the five worst suburbs of Sydney the difficulty with that is that if there's not many sales transactions  the statistics can look off in that if there's only half a dozen transaction low price properties  all of a sudden you you can say gee the the market's dropped by fifty percent in this suburb. It isn't the case. It is not the case. There's a lot of stock on the market. That's an issue. With the number of stock and a b a b a buy a supply and demand type issues. But with I thi I I don't know the numbers exactly but there's something like five thousand new people that that are living in Sydney every week. Something something the numbers are just frightening. The stock will get soaked up in a I think a short period of time and I I I think this is gunna be a few months  and after three or four months we'll be sort of  the growth rates won't be huge like we saw in the last few years but that isn't the case you can't get growth rates in thirty 'n' forty percent a year forever. It can't go like that so.

 There are some bargains out there Mark.

 There are some barg. It is a buyer's market. It's good. It's there's some bargains out there. Don't be afraid to put your hand up at auction and uh  if you're not the underbidder or or or you're not gunna be um  looking or targeting the property. Luke's  looking at me strangely . I'm just trying to get what I'm m thinking across. If you're not gunna be targeting the if want the property and you wanna buy the property. The price is X. You are at Y. You should really negotiate with the owner until such time as you're owning the property. If you gunna walk away from it and say well the market's still gunna keep on going down down 'n' down  I think you might be shocked and I think that it might turn around look interest rates has remain the same last week. They remain the same. Auction clearance rates have are horrendous at thirty-five percent which is terribly bad. But it's a big day in the real estate calendar this week and today is the sale of the heart the House of Hearts.

 And we'll talk about that in just a little while but it is a ve very very good cause.

We'll actually talk to one of the organisers of that earlier on this morning.

 We can a.

 But we'll get to callers which are the most important thing.

 That is the most important thing. That's why we're here. One-three-one-eight-seven-three if you'd like to register for  uh for Mark Moraza and Sydney Real Estate let's go to Norah Heads  and Lee is on line. Soldiers Point Drive. It's a four bedroom home I believe hello Lee.

 Hi Mark how are you?

 Oh I'm very well this morning.

 That's good.

 Norah Heads .

 In Norah Head yeah.

 What d type of property have you got for us this morning.

 Well I've got four bedroom brick um two bathrooms huge rumpus room. All living reh areas upstairs with ocean views. Vaulted ceilings. Big deck.

 Now upstairs and downstairs with the views uh the living. How do you mean the living areas. That's.

 All the all the we've I've got um.

 It's like a re.

  open plan home. 

 Okay and the  kitchen and so forth  is upstairs. 

 Yes kitchen dining and lounge are upstairs. Um all windows across the front all doors actually are overlooking the ocean.

 And the r the street that you're on the Soldiers  Point Road it is a bit of a main road isn't it.

 Yes.

 Now uh does it carry much traffic during the evening and morning.

 Uh no. Through the day mainly uh traffic to the beach. 'Cos I've got the beach Soldiers Beach um two minutes down the road.

 Okay well there's um  uh there's a wide price range in your s in in the whole of Norah Head. There's there's the median price is four-hundred-and-sixty-thousand dollars . A property on the street that you're on sold for around about three-hundred-and-ninety-thousand dollars . Another property in the street you're on sold for nine-hundred-thousand dollars . Uh there's a property on Bald Street that sold at over a million dollars . So it's just somewhat all over the place so it's very difficult for me to give you an accurate opinion. It all comes down to view. 

 Well yeah.

 Now you're just saying that you've got a uninterrupted is it mm.

 Oh only trees. I've got a um a hockey field directly across the road . Um and then from there on I've only got trees that line um the beach.

 Lovely. Well  the median's around about four-hundred-and-sixty. I'd put it a little bit above that. It probably is gunna be in excess of half a million dollars. It could well be much more than that.

 Alright thank you for you call. Let's uh go to Seven Hills Michael is  in Columbia Road at Seven Hills. Hi Michael.

 Howdy. Yeah I'd like to find uh how much uh  it's my mum's house and she wants to sell out everything and retire so I'm just looking at  you know what she could get for it.

 Well it's lovely. It's a pleasant little street. It's very quiet. There's some sales on the street itself um. The street itself I think uh are they w uh weatherboard 'n' and fibro houses on that street. 

 Nah it's mostly brick and they're they're starting to go two-storey. People are.

 Oh I . He's he's just dropped out we'll get him can we get him back please. I'm sorry about that  he he's just dropped out it was  uh the wrong line there. I've uh got meant to get rid of Lee m he's he's gone. So we'll go to another call. C uh we'll we'll get him back. We'll get him straight back. Cathy hello.

 Hi Mark Hi uh Luke. Um what I'm enquiring about is um a new development at uh at Maroubra Junction. I don't know Mark if you're familiar with it at all. It was the old Stockland mall  and uh they're building quite a large complex of uh uh shops shops below and a whole lot of units up above. Well  we're eh.

 I very much like those type of developments. There's  one in um St Leonards called the Forum  and it's above the railway station.

 That's right I know that one too.

 It's it's fa I mean great concept. You're in a a a block of units at the ground floor you've got all your shops you've got  absolutely brilliant transport because you get  to the bottom floor theh you get onto a train.

 Yeah so you like that concept.

 I love it. I think it's  fantastic concept.

 Yeah I wanted your opinion. And what but what it is though the thing is um you have to pu uh we're interested in a one bedroom unit with a study . And the price is um four-hundred-and-fifty- uh thousand dollars including like a courtyard. Some of them don't have courtyards they're a bit cheaper. 

 Okay now what do you think the rent's gunna be.

 Wuh the uh the agent said about three-fifty. 

 Okay well I would call another three or four agents and ask them the same question what they believe the rent should be . Not the not the agent of course that's selling it . But other agents around the place and see what the what they believe in value. Three-hundred-and-fifty th uh dollars a week rent and you how much are they asking four-sixty.

 Four y four or four-fifty anyway but.

 Four-fifty.

 Mm doesn't seem much sort of uh.

 N n 'n' not much return at all . Yes . Well there could be an issue with the price.

 See and another thing too you're buying off the plan. You you have to put a five-thousand dollar holding deposit  and they won't be ready for about three years . If we don't even know what we're buying virtually. We y'know w like would they show us the picture we give five-thousand dollars deposit  and then um.

 Look a lotta people have done that bought off the plan and a lot of  lotta people have done quite well.

 Oh look don't get .

 But you can't lose five grand for three years.

 Usually I tell you what. I w I I wouldn't I .

 Yeah but the thing is you're buying at today's.

 The only trouble is I'm just a bit worried with this. The new laws that have come out.

 Don't worry about that. That's the  no no that's that's the way it is.

 Oh okay then and you s co 'cos like there's a 'cos there's a s slump in the market 'n' I I y'know I'm just a little bit worried in case it goes down down down.

 Well I think that in three years time I think we'll be outta that. Oh I think we will well and truly outta that  in three years  count down track. The idea with buying off the plan and  it it will take a p a fairly brave person to be buying off the plan now and having completion soon. Well the people that have bought off the plan say for instance twelve months ago  and are having to complete now. They have  they have they have issues. There's no question about that  there are issues in that in that in that area but. 

 So three years down the track you reckon it'd be safe to go ahead.

 W well I tell you what. It takes a very brave person to do forecasting and I and I don't really like doing it. 

 Oh no that's right of course. I r I realise that and the market is just so up and down  the time too.

 But it  historically if you wanna take figures back for the last one-hundred years or so. 

 It's only ever gone up.

 It's only ever gone up by around about between eight and ten percent per year  year in year out. And real estate is not a short investment. It's not like stocks where you buy it today and sell  it in three months time. It's a medium to long term investment. So look I think it's fairly safe. I think you you might wanna go back to the developers and and try to negotiate on that price of four-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars. But uh look I I wouldn't be afraid of buying something now and then in three years time. The idea is that today's value is four-hundred-and-sixty and the price in three years time it might be five-hundred-and-twenty-thousand dollars . So you're buying at today's value and you're paying it in three years time. That's the only difference.

 Okay but get some other get some other quotes from other agents Cathy and find out what that rent should be. Eighteen minutes past nine. We'll take a break. Mike poor old Michael from Seven Hills he's back. We'll get back to him in just a moment. we'll also head out to Auburn  uh we cou we'll h be heading to Liverpool and St Clair. We could be coming to your neck of the cor neck of the woods. And Mark will do Around the Grounds we'll look at auctions today with Cindy Martin and we'll find out what's happening at uh w at Westmead today at Kellyville.

 Yes it's oh I think it's a lovely story the House of Hearts is up for sale today so if you're interested in buying a  if you wanna take your heart with you and you're interested in buying a property  there's one for sale here at eleven o'clock and I think it might be a good buy. It's definitely going to sell there's no question about that.

 Eighteen after nine Two G B.



 Twenty-two past nine. We'll go back to calls um and uh Michael from Seven Hills we we're sorry about that Michael you back.

 I am yeah.

 Yes okay. Michael the you you've got this th three bedroom home in Columbia Road at Seven Hills.

 I have yep. And it's a it's a they're mostly you're asking about what sorta houses they're mostly brick uh and there's quite a few going up  the second storey.

 Well I've got uh a wide pri a fairly wide price range. There's sales in the high threes early fours. And there's sales in the high twos . Which is  telling me there's s really two different styles of homes. It's fairly big homes with the four-hundreds and small little two three bedroom  maybe even fibro type homes at the high twos. It's  seems to be a very good buy. Seven Hills is only a stone's throw from Parramatta and if you're buying a property at at two-hundred-and-seventy or two-hundred-and-eighty-thousand dollars there that seems to be very very good value. The highest price in your street so far  is four-hundred-and-twenty-seven-thousand dollars  and it was achieved at the very very end of last year. So  that's the highest price. Your mum's property is it uh kitchens and bathrooms they're fairly original are they.

 Nah yeah it is actually. It needs quite a bit of bit of a reno and the other thing is I she's looking at selling it to family like I might take it over so I'm sorta looking at  y'know what's what's it we what it's really worth and sort of.

 Well  I tell you what. If you wanna do it that way  what it's really worth is to get a valuer . To come in and perhaps even more than one valuer. Perhaps two or three and get them to do a valuation draw a line through the centre and that should be the price you pay. But ih.

  how how would how does Seven Hills Compare to Blacktown. Does it make a big difference being in uh difference like Blacktown's obviously gone through a boom but.

 Tt wuh  Seven Hills has too. Seven Hills has too. The only thing with Seven Hills it's a little bit older. That's all . It's a little bit more original uh in Blacktown there's a lot of new developments and a lot of big brand new homes whereas Seven Hills've got still got y'know the old fibros and weatherboards  uh all over the place but look Seven Hills is much closer uh to Parramatta C B D than than Blacktown is. 

 Yeah wuh especially this one. This is Seven Hills sort of south. In the southern end of it. Tt closer .

 Well just imagine the C B D of Sydney  and what close to Sydney for instance Newtown. Now you gotta pay a lotta money if you wanna live in Newtown. Because it's so close to the city . And Ultimo and so forth so  that's a big issue and Seven Hills is so close to Parramatta C B D  that that's what drives the price of Seven Hills is the proximity to the main hub centre which is Parramatta but I mean some people call that the centre of Sydney.

 But then Blacktown's just the next suburb along and  you know depending on how clo so it's how mu does it make it that much different.

 You're just dealing with different type properties in Blacktown you got newer and bigger homes.

 I was just thinking more like along the lines of the name like if you've got the street address Blacktown or Seven Hills just the  does the concept d d you know does sev does Seven Hills just have a better price because it's not because it's not Blacktown.

 Oh yes that ih that that is a that is an issue uh uh and that happens all over Sydney. It happens in in the North Shore when you when you the uh the train line cutting off from south to east. So you get um for instance like South Turramurra doesn't achieve prices as well as North Turramurra or Turramurra proper. And you're getting of course you're getting the the uh Cremornes and Cremorne Points. Ih ih if it was called Seven Hills Heights you'd probably get more money but it it's all relative . Uh.

  Seven Hills South which see which s  to some people's mind South seems to do it . But um.

 Look it's all relative if you  you can't move the house. That's that's one point about real estate. If it's uh you you can't move the bl the block of land if  where it is is where it is and that's will get the price that it should achieve with the area that it's in . Get a few valuers I think it's probably worth mid threes  um but certainly.

 With other with other people going up  which is this sort of over the last few years there's it there is quite a f you know more and more people going up the second story . Would that do a dramatic change in you know if you get say another .

 Probably not.

  nah.

 No probably not. Uh I.

 Would it be like the hills you know like like the hills area   they sort of went.

 That's right. Look I've put it at three-fifty. If you put another storey on it'd cost you probably a hundred-and-fifty that's owes you  uh four-hundred-and-fifty five-hundred-thousand dollars and you're not gunna get a profit outta that. You're not gunna sell it for six-hundred or seven-hundred. It's not gunna happen so  yes . Answer the question neatly.

 Okay.

 Alright thanks.

 Thanks Michael thanks and thanks for being patient. Twenty-six minutes past nine here at Two G B.



 As Mark was saying earlier something wonderful is about to happen in Sydney at eleven O'clock this morning well we hope we hope this property sells at eleven O clock. We're talking about the House of Hearts. And uh on the telephone line is Gilly Paxton who is the project manager. Gilly Good morning.  Hello Gilly.

 Hi I'm good how are you very exciting out here this morning.

 Yes it sounds you're doing face painting and so forth so it's a good family day out for everybody isn't it.

 Absolutely it's a wonderful family day out and you're very kind calling me the project manager. I'm just just the person who's looking after it for the Children's Hospital at Westmead. I think all the credit this morning has to go to Landcom and Cosmopolitan Living in Integrated Design and all of the hundreds of people who donated so much time and energy and labour and materials and equipment et cetera for us to build the house in the first instance . And the noise you can hear now is the generator for the jumping castle.

 Oh fantastic the jumping castle'll be up and running the proceeds go to the Children's Hospital at Westmead the cardiology unit. It's a wonderful idea. How long has it taken to get to get from nothing to this.

 Ooh um Landcom probably first came to us with the idea oh well over eighteen months ago. Um and of course we were absolutely stoked at the notion of doing this with them. Um and Cosmopolitan Living the builders came on board very quickly as did Integrated design. In fact throughout the whole of the project we have been inundated with people saying yes I want to help I want to help. And so today is actually the culmination of all of that hard work. Um and fingers crossed and we're all very excited and it is gunna make um an enormous difference to cardiac kids at the Children's Hospital at Westmead. We're talking about children who may have a heart the size of a twenty cent piece. Um and we have surgeons who are able to operate on that. Um completely different to adult cardiac surgery. Um and we would operate on probably close to five-hundred children every year. And so what this project is doing is enabling us to do that even better.

 What's the house worth. Mark what do you think.

 Well  I don't wanna p uh preject pre  pre-empt any pricing but I would suggest it's a it's a brand new home. It has the top of the line everything. It's got a pool. I think it's got five bedrooms has it Gilly.

 Yeah it sure has.

 It's got five  bedrooms. En suite. It's it's a great prope. It is brand new. It's got top of the line stuff. I wuh it wouldn't surprise me it would not surprise me at all 'n' I've looked up Kellyville 'n' the area. The the median price in Kellyville's well in the high fives early sixes. It would not surprise me if this achieved well into the six-hundreds. Uh uh. The other thing ou ih th that I wanna uh say is that  not only is it a good cause but there are uh there there could be some other companies out there that might even help this along some of the big ends  of town that might want a go. I remember the um th The Block. One of the  properties was sold to Crazy John  as a marketing ploy. But it's for a good cause so .

 This is for a much better cause than The Block.

  the the crazy uh the Crazy Johns out there the A G Ls the Telstras the Foxtels and Optuses. They might want to uh scramble to the telephones and see if they can ru tt rumble up some money and uh can get out there and put their uh their cards up and uh buy a great property at a good uh for a good cause.

 Okay. Now I believe that the uh the Parramatta Eels will be visiting there today  as you mentioned there's house there's house painting  . There's face painting .

  Well it is a real estate show.

 They get the they get the rollers out  . And just and just cover you with Solarguard . No there's face painting there's a sausage sizzle the Parramatta Eels are coming out the the jumping castle's out there the Kellyville rural fire service will also be there. You're there until early this afternoon. The site is Blue Bell Circuit  corner of Samantha Riley and Redden Drives at Kellyville. It's behind New Home World.  And uh Gilly we'll have to leave it there but I'd be ve very interested to talk to you after the auction  if uh that should happen before midday and find out how much it went for. Can you do that for me.

 Absolutely. It should all be over by about eleven-thirty.

 Okay l let us know  let us know as soon as you have a result will you. 

 Sure course I will.

 I'll put you back to Linda su uh su uh to Daisy 'n' we'll we'll get your details. Thank you very much Gilly Paxton  who's been working hard along with a lot of other people to get this up and running. The House of Hearts at Kellyville. Proceeds going to the Children's Hospital at Westmead the cardiology unit. If you're after a fantastic home. Five bedrooms swimming pool landscaping it's all been donated. Looks like a terrific place. Uh it might be the home for you today. It's nine-thirty we got news with Brianna coming up this is Two G B.
 


 Yes good morning and welcome back to Sydney Real Estate it's twenty-one minutes to ten after ten Doc Graham with Your Health. And then Andrew Moore is hosting a very very special version of the Continuous Call Team this afternoon as we remember Chippy Frilingos. Terrible news this week we're s everyone at Two G B just shattered there's  not much more you can add. Twenty-one minutes to ten. His funeral will be at s uh uh at uh Saint Andrew's on uh on Monday. I believe. Let's go back to calls. Jenny is at uh Park Road at Auburn. Another house at Auburn. Good morning Jen.

 Hello how are you.

 We're well. 

 That's good. Um I was just wondering for some information on my house at two-hundred-and-thirty Park Road  . It's um.

 You've just opened yourself to a lot of phone calls from r real estate agents now Jenny.

 Oh have I.

 Yes you have. But continue on.

 Okay well I'm not actually putting it up for sale at the moment I'm just making enquiries.

 Oh good. I hope all those agents are listening to that as well.

 Yeah . Um now I just wanted to find out it's a two-storey house.

 How many bedrooms. Has it got six bedrooms.

 Six bedrooms yes. So there's three upstairs. There's a lounge room bathroom and the three bedrooms. Uh and downstairs there's three bedrooms a lounge room sun room dow dining room back veranda  laundry. You know all the normal facilities. The kitchen's only relatively new and the bathroom  is only relatively new.

 Okay that's a lotta house sitting on I've got you down at around about just under seven-hundred square metres. 

 Yep.

 Um  it's not a quiet street you live on is it Jenny.

 No but the house is situated back on the block of land  so that means that it's not right on the on the street and if you notice the other houses are a lot m more forward than ours so our house is virtually in the middle of the block.

 It is yes I can see that . The theh both  th in fact both of the houses left and right're like exactly what you're saying both the houses uh are set much more forward  than your prohpropry .

 Yeah so that does give us uh a buffer for noise and you know it's one of those things that you get used to  once you've lived there for a while so that's never been a um you know  a problem.

 One of the uh. Can you remember what you paid for it back in nineteen-seventy-nine.

 Uh yes we paid  oh twenty.

 No you didn't you paid a little bit more.

 Thirty-four.

 Thirty-eight.

 Thirty-eight. Sorry yeah sorry.

 Isn't it fantastic as time progresses and you look back and you can say gee whizz. I mean we're looking at the prices today and say gee whizz that seven-hundred-thousand oh that's an awful lotta money . We look back in another thirty years time and say gee that was cheap. I mean  like like this. At the time when you bought it  back in nineteen-seventy-nine thirty-eight-thousand dollars was probably a lot of money.

 It was a lot of money. We thought wow how are we ever gunna pay that off .

 Well I just hope all the other people out there that are s that are considering buying real estate and have said no no no this is it I'm not gunna buy it anymore. The property market's gunna crash so let's just sit back on the sidelines again . Um over time it's gunna race away from you and you won't be able to buy another property. So  that's a bit of a lesson for everybody . You don't don't hold back because over time this is what happens. Thirty-eight-thousand dollars in nineteen-seventy-nine and now today it's worth about six-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars.

 Six five zero.

 Yep.

 Okay. .

 Across the road sold for four-hundred-and-two-thousand but it's only a three bedroom. It is a busy street. It's got a lot of accommodation. And Auburn  uh w when you talk about supply and demand there is a lot of demand for property in Auburn. And there is probably also a lot of demand for the type of property that has a lot of accommodation like yourself.

 So about six-fifty Mark.

 Six-hundred-and-fifty-thousand dollars today.

 Not bad s considering you bought it for thirty-four back in uh seventy-nine. Jen well done. Thanks for your call. To Michelle now at Sans Souci. She's Rocky Point Road. Hi Michelle.

 Morning.

 Morning.

 Um we've m we've bought the place in Rocky Point Road.

 And what are you doing. You've had enough and you wanna sell out.

 No no no we've just bought it actually. We moved moving from an apartment  we've had enough of . Um it's a two three bedroom place . It's um new kitchen 'n'.

 It's not a quiet street again. Rocky Point Road.

 No no. It's a noisy street.

 Yes that's okay . Are you okay with the noise.

 Well it's it's not too bad it's got um  double glazed windows and   shutters so . we had an inspection at six o'clock and when all the traffic was there and there was. Couldn't hear anything so it was okay.

 Yeah I've said this a few times. The the the I guess the most frustrating p uh part of the traffic is the traffic or the trucks that that drive past  when you're fast asleep at four o'clock in the morning you're you're dreaming nicely and all of a sudden you get shocked awake by the rumble of a truck  coming past. That's that's what frustrated me so much when I lived on a train line um . It was when you're in a dead sleep and all of a sudden at at at the four-thirty train to go into the city just get j shock you awake and just frustrating. But anyway . Continue on.

 Okay. It.

 You've negotiated it quite well . It seems to be that it was on the market at around about s uh seven-hundred-and-thirty seven-hundred-and-forty-thousand dollars . And you brought that down to closer to seven-hundred-and-twenty. What did you actually pay at the end of the day.

 Six-seventy-five.

 Wow. Six-seventy-five . Great buy . Two words great buy. Yep. Fantastic . Well done. You've you uh good negotiation. You got a good buy. Theh there's some good buys out there and I think uh this one is one of them. You you've there's some good buys out there in the real estate world at the moment . People are negotiating and their prices. This one has been negotiated quite heavily 'n' you've you've done a good job of doing that . You got a good buy and I think you'll look back over time and s and and you'll make a profit.

 Oh good. So  y what do you think of Sans Souci as the area in general. Like I know we're on Rocky Point Road but.

 Sans Souci's great. It's very exclusive. It's a very small suburb. That's wu uh I guess one of the advan like s like a McMahon's Point of the world. Uh  Sans Souci's uh o on a water type front suburb. It's a tiny little suburb which  quite frankly. There's hardly any properties in it and if you want to be part of Sans Souci then you've gotta buy one of the very few properties that are there . Just like McMahon's Point I think there's something like  I remember this fact.  looking at data and statistics all the time. There's something like seven-hundred properties in muh McMahon's Point . That's it. And if you wanna be part of McMahon's Point then you gotta be one of those seven-hundred properties that are purchased. So  a a case of supply and demand. There's a lotta people that wanna live there . Uh but there's only a few people that can afford it. And I think Sans Souci is a similar type suburb. Very small  waterfront property. It's got a really nice indeed  I'm just thinking of the geography but it's got a really nice little headland it's tucked away  it's it's away from the sorta traffic and so forth . Other than your property . Uh but well done. Good negotiation. Six-seventy-five. I think it's a great buy.

 Well done . Thanks Michelle.

 Bye-bye.

 Bye-bye now.



 Yeah good onya Ozinvest it's uh uh tell you what there are a lot of people investing in Queensland.  I've just come back from the Gold Coast. They are building the largest  um  residential apartment block in the southern hemisphere. It will be eighty-nine floors high. And we were we're having a look at uh a property in the Peninsula. You know that b.

 Yes I know the building.

 You know the building. We were on the fortieth floor and we looked straight across at floor thirty-eight  of this thing. So it's gunna be  it's gunna be th a a third the size again of the Peninsula which is huge. It's uh it's just amazing. Apparently it has a sway  it has a sway uh uh leverage of a meter. In in high winds. I mean it's just .

 Oh no that's fantastic isn't it.

 Ih ih if you think of the movie The Towering Inferno. You remember how tall that thas whi ih is . Un unbelievable. Eighty-nine fl stories so people are obviously investing in south eastern Queensland as we thought they would. Cindy Martin is out and about today. Cindy good morning.

 Hey Luke hey Mark how you going.

 We're going very well. Do you know much about this big  block in in uh on the.

  actually seen it 'n'. Well I when I say seen it I've seen all the plans and everything for it. It's uh it's gunna be massive absolutely massive.

 Well  theh theh there's gunna be another shadow on the unfortunately gunna be another shadow on the Gold Coast beaches.

 Yes I think that. A very very big shadow.

 A very big shadow which is a shame. El all the bathers are gunna have to move sideways of the shadow if they wanna get a tan.

 That's exactly right.

 But but think of the su  but su think of the sun cancer it's saving  . 

  That's a good one. That is very good Luke.

 Thank you.

 You are very quick aren't you.

 Sponsored sponsored by the Cancer Council this building.

  That was good wasn't it.

 Okay Cindy what's happening today.

 Well I ca I shouldn't admit this. Do you know what I just did. I just turned up at an auction that's not on till next Saturday. Isn't that smart. So I think I'm on drugs today.

 No Cindy you're a bit early.

  You said it for me. But brilliant auction it'll be great for next week so we'll do Groundhog Day next week and I'll do the uh uh talk to you from there next week. 

 Are you going out to Kellyville today.

 Um no actually I'm not going out to Kellyville. I've got the other auctions on. There's um someone else from work going out to Kellyville but  that auction'll be fantastic. I wish I was going out to Kellyville today.

 Mark thinks it will get up into the sixes.

 I I think that's probably right. I think Mark's probably on the nose there. So .

 And I t. More importantly  I w it'd be nice to just see some big companies go out there and do some  perhaps some stunt marketing and uh put their hand up for a very very good cause. I think everyone should scramble to their telephone call the boss and say can I buy a property today boss. It'll be a great marketing tool.

 I thi I think that's that's right 'n' I you know  goes well for for their sake 'cos a lot of people have put a lot of effort into it and uh you know it started with the idea from Landcom giving them the land and then it's just moved on from there and it's it's taken um you know it's taken a long time to put it all together 'n' I spoke to one very excited um lady from Westmead Hospital yesterday and she said she just can't believe it's all coming to uh to tail end now so. Yeah so it'll be that'll be a fantastic auction.

 Well we'll find out wha what they uh what they get about eleven-thirty this morning. We'll cross back to the house. Wha so what auctions are on today.

 On  today I'm heading off to Paddington. I hope that auction's on today. No I'm sure that one's on today. Uh there's a terrace going up in Hargrave Street Paddington and expecting a lot of people at that. Big auction for today I think is probably Lodge Street at Glebe. There's a house going up there there are hundreds of people interested in that house so um that's gunna be a big auction. There's uh there's quite quite a few up today so it'll it'll be a good day.

 It should be.

 There's a surprise I'm just getting flagged down by the police for talking on my mobile phone .

 Bring your cheque book.

 Bring your cheque book and uh every cent that goes on this house goes to Westmead Children's Hospital  the cardiology unit. It's a very very good cause and uh everything's been donated so it's just a sensational community effort five to ten.



 Just very quickly one to uh ten. News is coming up Rod Burridge from uh First National's just rung up. G'day Rod.

 G'day Rod.

 Oh g g'day Mark and Luke just very quickly. I think Mark what's important with these uh these home units these new ones and this and the high rise ones is who the builder is and I think if buyers check out the builder  quite often it'll help them decide on uh whether to buy or not or negotiate. And and I think .

 And when you're saying checking out the builder it's got to do with uh going to the body croport  and looking at what has happened with the older buildings that they've built and see what some of the issues in in their building techniques.

 Exactly and I think ask the agent who the builder was and certain builders who we won't mention  uh y y you you'd you'd probably favour one over the other . I'm a I'm about to sell a a unit in a high rise one and I think if  yeah the vendor and the agents get their heads together the right way they get a very good price.

 Alright Rod thanks for that gotta go news is on us . Thanks for your call mate bye-bye. There. Good advice yeah check out the builder thank you Mark. Mark Moraza  from R P Data property dot com dot A U is where you'll find him. The doctor is in next Dr Graham we can start taking his calls  because the surgery is open.

"
" The doctor is in the lines are open one-three-one-eight-seven-three Two G B dot com click on the Dr Graham feedback icon and  we'll attempt to uh answer as many emails as we can and get through as many calls as we possibly can good morning Doc.

 Good morning Luke how are ya.

 Not too bad.

 That's good. Beautiful day I thought we were gonna get some rain yesterday but it didn't happen. We need it badly don't we. Really badly. Oh goodness gracious me. What sort of a week have you had.

 I've had a very relaxing week cos I had a few days off.

 Ah.

 Went up to the Gold Coast and just did nothing for a week it was beautiful weather. 

 Ah

 Except when that wind comes up about two o'clock in the afternoon it rips up there doesn't it.

 It really does I've gotta fly to the coast tomorrow very quickly and be back Monday night but uh got some work to do up there but gee whizz  it's a beautiful spot there's no doubt about that isn't it.

 Now there's a wu wonderful activity happening out at Kellyville today we m did mention this earlier. It's the House  of Hearts  house that's up for auction.  It uh proceeds go to the children's hospital at Westmead now this whole house the building the landscaping the pool everything  has been donated  and so it's a hundred percent profit going to the hospital uh their cardiology unit. They've got doctors there that are operating on little kids' hearts as big as a twenty cent piece it's just .

 And you should sy see the size of the doctors' hands. They're huge and how they do it I don't know.

 So we'll cross back out to the auction and find out how much they got after eleven.

 You know something even more amazing than being able to operate on people's hearts like that  is knowing in advance of going in there exactly what's going on. And the ultras the ultrasound techniques that they've got to ultrasound children's hearts at the moment  is unbelievable.

 Absolutely. All also we've got um uh All Things Medical and Men today.

 All things male and medical at quarter to twelve today. Very interesting one today uh at wuh uwh it's centred around the diseases that have a common symptom erectile dysfunction. Should be very interesting we're interviewing a doctor from Perth Dr Dennis Cherry  who's the director of the medic uh the Perth Human Sexuality Centre. Should be very interesting.

 Well also with Mother's Day being uh tomorrow it's a good time to look at osteoporosis and vitamin D. We're gonna talk to Dr Toomie from James Lance Medicines Research Unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital  about exactly that very shortly.

 Are we. Good that should be really good.

 It will indeed so ih uh it's lots happening here today on Your Health with Doc Graham 'n' Luke Bona here at Two G B. Julie good morning.

 Good morning.

 Morning Julie Dr Graham speaking.

 Oh how do you do um.

 I'm well.

 I'm glad uh.

 I'm glad too.

  What about phlebitis

 What about it.

 Yeah what about it. I think I've got it.

 Okay.

 I'm uh ih and uh you know the advice is keep your leg up.

 Yes.

  And I said well you know it really is very difficult to be walking around with your leg in the air.

 It's not easy is it.

 I mean you could could put a flag on it 'n' something or other but it really is it's difficult.

 Well let's talk about what it is first of all.  It's an inflammation or an infection of the veins of your leg.

 No infection.

 Um  probably a low grade infection I would've thought.

 Oh really.

 Yep. How old are you.

  seventy-eight.

 Don't sound seventy-eight  good for you . Have you got any varicose veins.

 Uh one up the top of the the I've had both hips replaced.  And uh this I have to tell you occurred after I broke my ankle.  Which was about four years ago.  And um the cast that they put on was  too tight . And the after a week m and my toes turned blue and looked like blue sausages  um uh the cast went from the toes to the uh knee   and uh I had it it had to be cut off because I just couldn't stand it.  And then they put another one on.  And for ten weeks I had the other one on  I reckoned it was still too tight and I ended up with two D V Ts.

 Oh goodness gracious me.  W the the bottom line out of all of that whether it's the cast whether it's the brah when wi.

  Started from.

 Whether it's the cast whether it's the broken ankle or whether it's the clot  is that the venous return to your heart has  been interfered with . The other common reason  is varicose veins . Now what happens is you do get a low grade infection or or inflammation in those veins and it's very difficult to avoid getting it. The person who told you to elevate your leg is absolutely correct and as you quite rightly point out it's very di   time. Have you got any telephone books underneath the foot of you bed.

 No.

 That's number one.  Now the reason you put them underneath the foot of your bed  is to raise the foot of your bed and to help the venous drainage. Now  that at least prevents the veins from becoming congested for about eight or nine hours a day and that's a great start.  If you don't they're congested when you get up and you don't give them a chance to get better that's the first thing.

 Well I used to put my legs against the wall at night.   before I go to sleep.

 But elevating the foot of the bed is the first thing. Number two to improve the circulation somewhat it is often wise to take some soluble aspirin if you are not on a blood thinning agent. Number three often  when they do get acutely inflamed they are infected and you may need some antibiotics. So there we are simple common sense things elevate the foot of your bed two telephone books soluble aspirin and occasionally antibiotics.



 Val good morning.

 Good morning Doctor.

 How are you?

 Oh pretty good.

 That's good.

 Um I I do have trouble though um most nights  cramps in the legs . Um sometimes it'll happen two or three times in the one night and the only relief I get is to get up and walk around.  Um during the day just walking around the house I don't have any problem  but if I want to do a serious walk  I do develop cramps in the calves . But the the night cramps can be .

 Night time cramps are the awful aren't they they're terrible.

 Yeah they are. It could be and and they're in various parts sometimes it's just the big toe  sometimes it's the underneath the arch uh sometimes in the calves um I did consult my G P who suggested uh I should have my electrolytes checked . Uh and he did a full blood test  but everything was  in normal limits.

 Yep. We don't really know what causes cramps we've we used to say it was salt depletion but I don't really think that it is. We know they're very common number one in the elderly number and I guess you're not as young as you used to be none of us are. Uh number two in those people who've got varicose veins. The treatment is relatively simple . And it's good old fashioned quinine. It's been around for a long time quinine  um and it's n what they put in tonic water so I'm not saying that you have a gin and tonic before you got to bed  wha wha I know Luke would like to have a gin 'n'  um way to go  but what I am saying is ask your G P whether a little bit of quinine mightn't help the problem.

 Well I did suggest that to him  and he actually hadn't heard of it but somebody else had told me you know just drinking tonic water.

 Not you can't get enough quinine you've gotta drink about twenty gallons of tonic water.  So that's not good for a number of other reasons you won't get any sleep for another reason if you did that.

  Right . The the the quinine I take it is um prescribed is it.

 Uh yes it is . And it's called Biquinate and you you get it uh from the chemist on prescription.

 Right.

 Okay.

 Okay thanks very .

 It works all the time. Thanks Val.

 Okay bye. 

 Bye now.

 Thank you for your call it's a quarter past ten this is Two G B. It's Mother's Day tomorrow and uh a good time to look at osteoporosis looking after our bones and vitamin D. We'll do that in just a moment.



  minutes past and Mother's Day tomorrow.

 Indeed Mother's Day tomorrow and by definition our mothers are older than all of us and as ladies get old they amount of calcium in their bones starts to get less and less and less. On the line to talk to us about osteoporosis is Dr Jan Toomie from the James Lance medics Medicines Research Unit. Jan good morning.

 Good morning how are you.

 Well thanks how are you.

 Good thank you.

 What is osteoporosis.

 Well osteoporosis is simply Latin for holes in your bones. 

 Right.

 And what it means is that usually as we age um the the normal holes in the bones which we all have otherwise we'd be too heavy to stand up  get bigger and bigger and bigger and the bone gradually just becomes weaker and that predisposes us to fractures with minor trauma.

 Now as we get older that happens normally doesn't it.

 It does um and unfortunately what people think is is normal is also actually uh you know brings them to be at risk of fractures.

 So is ih by definition of the of the fact that we are getting older do we all get osteoporosis.

 We don't all get osteoporosis because the the definition of osteoporosis is a certain degree of bone loss. We all lose bone as we age though.

 Right now we we know that it's quite common in women or we seem to think that you know it's a matter of course in women. Do men get osteoporosis as well.

 They do certainly do um not as much as as women but it's a a major unrecognised health problem in men.

 Doctor why is it worse with women sorry l Luke here.

 Um because women start off with uh less calcium in their bones to begin with you know they've got smaller lighter bones to begin with  so they can't afford to lose as much bone as men.

 Jan I would have said that women are always more trouble than men anyway but I wasn't allowed to say that on air.

 High mai high maintenance is what you were actually about to say wasn't it.

 High maintenance is exactly right.  What do we do Jan about people who have osteoporosis.

 Well the first thing we need to do is make sure that their their calcium level their calcium intake is adequate . And um that they're getting enough exercise.

 'N' that's important that exercise is very important isn't it.

 That's right because exercise actually strengthens the bone . Um but we know that that's not enough in people who already um have osteoporosis. Um they need to cut down on the amount of coffee they drink because caffeine unfortunately is bad for your bones . Uh they should stop smoking if there aren't enough reasons to stop already . And they need to cut down their alcohol intake . Um and then if if they actually have osteoporosis then there are very good treatments uh available.

 What  what is the principle of treatment of osteoporosis.

 The the principle is to slow down the rate of bone loss. There are there are two types of cells in the bone and and one type builds up the bone and the other type breaks it down  and basically you want to change the balance because when you have osteoporosis the cells that are breaking it down are working faster than the cells that are building it up.

 What about vitamin supplements.

 Um vitamin D is a useful supplement um people used to think that in Australia because we get lots of sunlight  and listeners might know that most of our vitamin D is is made uh with exposure to sunlight . Um people used to think that it just wasn't an issue in Australia  but um there've been some very interesting studies which show that there're quite a significant number of Australians despite how sunny actually do have sub-optimal vitamin D levels  and the reason that we need vitamin D is that vitamin D is the thing that tells us to absorb calcium.

 Okay  we're talking with Dr Jan taoh uh Toomie who is from the James Lance Medicines Research Unit at the Prince of Wales Hospital we're talking about osteoporosis with Mother's Day tomorrow it's a timely reminder to uh look after our bones. Dr Jan there's a caller online from Bankstown that wants to ask you a question can you take it.

 Sure.

 Okay Anne from Bankstown Dr Jan Toomie. 

 Yes Doctor I'm eighty-eight and I've had o osteoporosis with the fractures for years  not knowing anything about it. I think it would be wise to talk to younger women  I uh over the years after I was uh near menstruation time I used to feel that the top of m oh the bottom part of my body didn't want to hold up the top . Then I had fractures or fracture in the lumbar area didn't know what it was just thought oh that's a terrible sharp pain  and then later on got some up further in the back. Now I've shrunk about six or seven inches   and in pain all the time I take Evista and Actonel  to prevent more fractures but life is a misery  because you're never out of pain the back burns like it's on fire I can feel cold but my back is always very hot . Is there anything else I could do I don't suppose so because.

 Well um unfortunately no I mean what what you've found is that once the fractures have occurred  you can't undo that . Um all you can do is try to prevent more fractures and and what you're taking is is uh just y'know it's the right thing to take . Um but you're quite right about addressing the problem with younger women to try to stop the fractures occurring in the first place.

 Yes  well I didn't know anybody with it I didn't  know the symptoms or anything about it.

 Well well one of the unfortunate things is that often uh there are no symptoms until you have a fracture. Just bone loss itself doesn't cause any pain. Um and so it it's something that the whole community really needs to be aware of as as a risk for all of us as we get older.

 Jan it's a really common complaint isn't it osteop.

 It is it's very common.

 And uh one thing we need to stress too is that the treatment is not immediate and I you know  it takes a long time to even slow the process down doesn't it.

 It does yes you certainly can't sort of take one pill and think well that's good I've fixed it.

 All over. Jan thank you very much for your time it is important and it's relevant with Mother's Day upon us tomorrow  be aware of osteoporosis.

 Yep and the Mother's Day tomorrow good time to start thinking about that. Dr Jan nice to talk to you.

 And to you thank you.

 Dr Jan Toomie from the James Lance Medicines Research Unit at the Prince of Wales it's twenty-five past ten Two G B.



 We'll take a break and we'll come back uh by the way your cue to call to go into the draw for the trip  for two to China includes airfares  to Beijing  four nights accommodation.

 Isn't there something about a yum cha brunch.

 Yes. Are you gunna come back for that on the Sunday.

 Might.

 Dude for a free feed I'm sure you will.

 Oh don't be like that I just like Chinese.

 It'll be Sunday the sixteenth of May we'll have a Chinese yum cha brunch thanks to the Golden Century restaurant here at Two G B. Your cue to call coming up between now and twelve but you must stay listening.



  to calls here  on your Your Health with Doc Graham.

 Merilyn good morning. Merilyn good morning.

 Good morning Dr Graham. Uh I was going to phone you a couple of weeks ago. I've had a hernia operation going on.

 What sort of a hernia hiatus hernia  or inguinal hernia.

 The one near the navel.

 Umbilical hernia.

 Yeah.

 Right.

 I had a had my gall bladder out twelve months ago and I had a got an infection after it and after having the infection operation I got the hernia . But what I'm um concerned about this morning is that um well I've had a lot of heartburn very  severe heartburn . I take Zoton  twice a day and that's  what doesn't hold it when I'm having a bad day  I have to drink milk . Um and I'm having funny bowel motions the day before yesterday I had to race to the toilet  and it was semi solid and and yellow . It was yellow and then this morning at four o'clock I was on the toilet   and I just had to sit and let it work it's way through . But um got very severe  stomach and abdomuh  abdominal pains and I'm just hoping it's a bug. 

 That sounds exactly  what it is just because you've had a hernia operation uh any sort of operation gall bladder operation hernia operation  doesn't mean that you can't get other things wrong with you and you still do you still get tonsillitis you still  get appendicitis and you can still get gastroenteritis which sounds like what you've got.

[C4 Nah  and because of the operation that's stirring the my tummy up.

 No. You would have the cramps whether you had the operation or not. 

 Oh right yes.

 It is due directly to the fact that you you've got some diarrhoea . And whatever's causing the diarrhoea is causing the cramps. It's not related I would think to the hernia operation or the gall bladder operation  or the infection . It would it may be  if you didn't have the diarrhoea and it's always a relief to me as a medical practitioner when somebody comes in and they say I've got this funny pain in my tummy and I say you had any diarrhoea and they say oh yeah I haven't been able to get off the toilet for a week 'n' I say well beauty  theh y'know that that that to me means that is more likely than not going to be the cause of your of your problem.

 Yeah well it's  not actual diarrhoea it'd be a one off.

 Change in bowel habit no  no no that's fine . Wouldn't be too concerned about that and I'm sure it hasn't got anything to do with the hernia operation.

 It's ten thirty-one time for news headlines.

 

 You're listening to Your Health with Doc Graham it's twenty-three to eleven.

 Tom good morning.

 Oh good morning Dr Graham. Uh it's Tom here as you know.

 Yes Tom.

 Uh look I wa I'd like to talk to you about uh postrate  um problems . Now I'm eighty-one years of age . Uh I don't get up through the night I'm very lucky there . Last examination was the postrate  was quite normal  but  my last blood test  my um P S A had doubled.

 To what.

 Oh now I that I don't know  but what I was wondering what is the next procedure if your P S A is up which I don't know what the level would be  before you have to have something else done and then I'd like to know what that is.

 Okay. L let's talk about P S As for one second. A P S A is a specific blood test which tells us the s the about your prostate. It doesn't tell us what's in your prostate but it does give us some indication of the size of your prostate . The P S A is elevated in people who have got cancer of the prostate. The P S A is elevated in people who have big prostates. And the P S A is elevated in people who have infected prostates. So it's a non-specific test. The most important thing that I said in all of that was  people who've got cancer of the prostate have elevated P S As. Now if you've got a normal size prostate and an elevated P S A or a rising P S A if you were one of my patients I think that should be looked at.

 I see.

 What I would sugge well if you were one of my patients what I would suggest to you is that you should go and see  a urologist and he would do an ultrasound guided biopsy of your prostate . In other words he would use an ultrasound to determine exactly the size of your prostate and he would stick a needle in your prostate and look at the tissue that he withdrew underneath the microscope . Now that is not terribly difficult procedure although it's not terribly comfortable it's not all that uncomfortable either and it gives us some idea a good idea really w of whether you have a nasty cancer growing in your or a cancer growing in your prostate.

 I see.

 Now that's the thing that we've gotta be concerned about. Whether or not the elevation in your P S A means that you have a prostatic malignancy. And I would really sugge I'd go back to your G P and have a chat  to him and say to him do you think that it's worthwhile going to see somebody about this.

 I see and they take what do they take a biopsy then do they.

 M he would send you to a urologist  and I think he would take a biopsy yes.

 Good. And and what about infection problems like um ih is is that minimum. Like. 

 After the biopsy as a result of the biopsy.

 Yes.

 Um it's possible to get an infection after you've had a biopsy done yes. But not having the biopsy done because you're frightened that you might get an infection is not reasonable . Because if you've got a cancer of the prostate there you want to know about it and the sooner you get it uh looked at the better  and believe me if I had to have a malignancy I would prefer to have a prostatic malignancy than just about anything else. Please go and speak to your G P and ask him whether he thinks that you mightn't be w better off going to see a specialist.



 Claire good morning.

 Oh good morning Dr Graham and Luke. Um I don't have a problem myself Doctor but last week you had a grandmother speaking about her eight year old grandson.

 Yes who  he he w he didn't seem to have the eye hand co-ordination.

 Um.

 Couldn't ride a bike.

  one thing wasn't it.

 Beg your pardon.

 Well I I didn't hear all of that last week but when I came in on it it was he he had p very poor co-ordination. 

 That's right  he he couldn't  ride a push bike they'd done everything.

 That's right now he's just so similar to my gra eight eight year old grandson . My daughter um a friend recommended gymnastics . She has him in which he is improving he has been going to that for about six months now  and also another thing  that I'd like to share what that lady may be able to do um is take him to a occupational therapist . Now that's where my grandson goes once a week she takes him out of school the occupational therapist said it's theh they have hypermobility.

 Hypermobility.

 Hypermobility yes the and the m the muscles are too flexible . Now my grandson had the same problem. He played soccer he couldn't at really play. He would skip along the soccer field  and we used to think what's the matter with him you know he played he didn't play football he does swimming he still learns swimming  he doesn't like putting his head in the water  like that lady's little grandson . And I thought that .

 I uh I know a couple of adults who're in that boat too.

 Pardon.

 I know a couple of adults who're in that boat too . No names no pack drill but my wife might be listening she gunna kill me when you get home.

 Yes and also it's uh I don't know about that lady's grandson but it's affected my grandson's writing ha ha he has poor writing . Um but they're working on it.

 Claire Claire that  isn't exactly the same that is not quite the same sort of story that that other lady had because there are other symptoms especially the writing. The writing would concern me . And I would make sure that he has his hearing assessed  uh and that he possibly goes and sees a um paediatrician  because although that other lady ch last week said the only thing that that child couldn't do was ride a push bike.

 Oh did she as I said I didn't quite I I wasn't in on it from the beginning.

 No uh  the only thing that the only thing that he couldn't do was ride a push bike. You've got a few your grandson has a few more symptoms  and I would definitely make sure that his hearing's okay and d and question whether he doesn't need a referral to a paediatrician.

 Thanks for your call Claire.

 Alright thank you Doctor bye.

 Bye now . Eighteen to eleven o'clock Two G B.

 Julie good morning.

 Good morning Dr Graham. Um I just wanted to ask you  I always seem to be inundated with sebaceous cysts . Uh are they a result of uncleanliness or dirtiness or.

 Not really um you probably have an oily skin and they are just really blocked sweat glands they're like big pimples and they're really a nuisance they're awful things.

 I know they're horrible.

 And they c do they get infected Julie.

 Quite often yes.

 How old are you.

 Oh me uh I'm fifty-two.

 Have you been checked for sugar.

 Uh I uh well a while ago yeah.

 Has anybody in your family got diabetes.

 No we haven't actually.

 Are you.

 I did I did I had  a test and for about a couple of months they thought I may have been I may have had diabetes but then it proved to be negative.

 Did you have the two hour sugar test the glucose tolerance test.

 No no they just took a blood test.

 Mm Julie I I would go back to your G P and and there there're a couple of issues here. Number one you you probably have an oily skin and they are blocked sweat glands so they're the sebaceous cysts. Number  two. They can get infected and it is not uncommon once you have one infected to get a whole crop of them infected as the result of the infection itself. But number three you really should make sure that you haven't got diabetes have you any children.

 No I don't I'm single no children.

 Okay and your mother or your father didn't have diabetes.

 No no.

 Okay. It's worth while getting that checked out again. The the gold standard to determine whether you have diabetes or not is a thing called a glucose tolerance test. It's a two hour test and they take about four lots of sh uh blood from you and from that you can tell absolutely whether you have diabetes or not so here we are  sebaceous cysts can be quite normal recurrent infections may be because of the infection that doesn't quite go away but be careful that haven't got an underlying problem diabetes which is the cause of the whole lot.

 And your chance to win a trip for two to China coming up soon between now and midday today stay listening for your cue to call. 

 Amy good morning.

 Hello.

 Hello Amy.

 Yes Dr Graham good morning.

 Good mor.

 Uh I had a question to the doctor the uh about osteoporosis . I missed out . I would like your advice please. Under my uh nephrologist uh instruction  I am not allowed to take any vitamin D no calcium nor vitamins C because I have got calculus history   my kidney . At the same time I have been on the Fosamax since four years now   but I'm on the Prednisone for my uh polymyalgia and Warfarin because on account of my mechanical valve . So I'm sort of you know I don't know what to do.

 Okay Amy I don't think I'd do anything other than what you're doing at the moment . Now there's no doubt that the Prednisone causes ost well makes the osteoporosis far more pronounced far quick far more quickly . But the Fosamax on the other hand should to a degree counterbalance that . One of the things that really was said was that the treatment for osteoporosis is not quick. It is a long term treatment . And you don't get magic cures it takes months and months and months and years  to see whether the medication that you're taking is doing any good . But you are at risk. From the sound of your voice you're  well you won't see sixty-five again. Um would that be correct.

 Yes.

 And you're on the Prednisone which is not helping your osteoporosis but  the Fosamax will counteract it so it's like a seesaw if you like. Um the Prednisone on one side  the Fosamax on the other side which one's going to be heavier which one's going to win . And I don't know the answer to that question but I they are on opposite sides of the seesaw they're certainly not on same side but I wouldn't change anything I'd be going exac along exactly the same way as you have been and wait and see what happens.



 Maureen good morning.

 Good morning Dr Graham.

 Yes.

 Um I was wondering uh if you could give me some information on P M R.

 Polymyalgia rheumatica.

 That's it.

 Okay. We just talking about that.

 Yeah I was diagnosed um about fourteen months ago with it . Um I've been on Prednisone . Um when I f was first diagnosed it was twenty-three . Um I went down. I.

 This is the dose of Prednisone you're talking about.

 No my blood test was .

 Oh ye yeah so right.

 Twenty-three . Um I got it down to six-point-seven  so I started cutting down on the Prednisone . It went up to twenty-eight . I went back up on the Prednisone.

 You didn't need the blood test to tell you that it wasn't good did you.

  No. Um it came down again to three-point-six. I cut down to one and half. The last three weeks I've been in absolute agony . Um I rang my doc this morning 'cos I had a blood test last week it's back up to twenty-three.

 Right okay. Polymyalgia rheumatica is an auto immune disease. That means your body decides that it wants to attack itself  and attacks your muscles and your joints. I must confess that I have been fooled by polymyalgia rheumatica uh on three or four occasions  it has just an unusual presentation. It can present as aching joints it can present as aching muscles it can present as aching knees. One thing about it in its acute phase it is you are sick. When  you have polymyalgia rheumatica you look sick you feel sick you feel absolutely miserable . I think probably the hardest part about polymyalgia rheumatica is diagnosing it  and I've certainly missed it and I make no bones about it I've missed it on a number of occasions because it isn't something that you think about. The diagnosis is usually made by well in my case anyway by a uh rheumatologist who I've sent people to . And the treatment is to reduce the inflammation  we don't know what makes the polymyalgia rheumatica start we don't know what makes it stop we don't know what makes it better we don't know what makes it worse but what we do know is that if you go onto Prednisone in significant doses you feel a lot better. Now I'm not a big fan of Prednisone never have been. It can.

 That's why I tried to cut down because I know the side effects from it myself and that.

 That's right . But it can save your life . And under these circumstances uh it ih you really haven't got a lot of choice.

 There's nothing else you can  do for it.

 There is nothing else that you can do for it but you do need to be under the care of a competent rheumatologist and I get the feeling and I'm just saying th I just get the impression  that those people who stay on the Prednisone a little bit longer than they should in the first instance in other words if your numbers go down to three and you feel okay and you immediately immediately go off the Prednisone uh the polymyalgia rheumatica tends to bounce back. Sometimes if you can stay on it just a little bit longer it is my impression and I say my impression I have no figures or nothing other than just a a a a G P's nose to back it up that those people don't seem to get the recurrence as quickly. But uh you do need to be under the care of a competent um rheumatologist.



 Marilyn good morning.

 Oh good morning Dr Graham. Um it sounds like it's all women's problems this morning .  Um I've my problem is .

 We have we've got Matters 'n' Male 'n' Medical coming up so we'll balance the equation a bit later on.

 Okay um my problem is uh I went off H R T in January and I took the you know I went through the doctor you know downsizing it and everything  then was off it for a couple of months and then the hot flushes and the sweats all came back again  and everything so I've chosen to go back on it again  so I don't know and I had been off it once before and when I took it again it more or less kicks in straight away  so I get rid of the hot flushes. Well I've it's uh pro uh it's probably only been a week but I'm still getting you know it hasn't doesn't feel any different. I'm just wondering how long does it take before the H R T .

 Almost immediately is normally the answer to that question provided you're taking enough of it. Which H R T are you taking.

 Uh it's um  it's the  it no it's the the tablets the ravera .

 Premarin and Provera.

 Yes yes  at six-point-two-five . And uh five milligrams.

 Yep. You may have to increase the Premarin a l the uh Premarin a little bit but  go and see your G P. The uh Marilyn the only thing that I do say to you is  this is an informed consent decision. You realise that there is an increased incidence of breast cancer an increased incidence of uterine cancer. Make sure you have your breasts checked regularly make sure you have regular pap smears. Because it is an informed consent decision but normally it kicks in pretty well straight away it may be that you need a little bit more oestrogen.

 

 Welcome back to Your Health with Doc Graham the lines are open on one-three-one-eight-seven-three Two G B dot com is where you'll find us on the net but can we can please  yeeeh you've got to keep your emails brief Doc haven't you d um don't tell us a short story just give us it quickly because it's very very hard to write through and and wade through it all so if you can be as as brief as you can that'd be great. All m uh m Matters Male and Medical coming up in about uh fif ooh twenty-five minutes.

 About twenty-five minutes yes. Um and it very interesting uh we're gunna have a talk today with Dr Dennis Cherry the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre. Um brought to us by uh Lilly Pharmaceuticals. And it really is talking about a lot of diseases that have one common symptom. Chris are you there good morning. 

 Yes yeah hi Doctor hi Luke how youse doing.

 Good thank you how are you.

 Yeah good thank you. Look I've actually um I think you answered some of my problems or some of my questions with the last calls . I've been o on Prednisone since October last year um for an on un undiagnosed muscle problem which  which they s seem to have um y y'know problems diagnosing and I'm just worried about long term effects 'cos everyone tells me  that that it gives you cataracts that it gives you osteo  that that it causes cancer and .

 Prednisone is a wonderful drug Chris but it must be used m absolutely totally and completely properly. It can save your life but it can also kill you and therein lies its paradox. Um who dy who couldn't diagnose what was wrong with your muscles.

 Okay um uh m uh it's my G P sent me to a rheumatologist.

 Yes.

 Um and she ee he he was sending me for all tests and I went for a lotta tests like um you know bone scans and X rays and wha.

 And did he say the magic words polymyalgia rheumatica or not.

 No he he didn't he said I was too young for it like I'm I'm I I'm I'm only forty . And I'm pi and he said to the to that he's never heard of it in in that age um but what it is it actually started in ih ih in my thigh muscles and sorta spread up to my shoulders . And um and the last few days I I've been trying to cut back ih some Prednisone I actually halved the dosage myself and I can feel coming back into my shoulders  and and without it I've um I'm like I really do have trouble functioning. I get so stiff and .

 Chris if you ca a Prednisone can be believe it or not addictive too. It was marketed in the original cuh case as an anti depressant because anybody on Prednisone feels really good  and then they go off it and they feel really bad. Prednisone does a couple of things to you. Number one it can increase your chances of osteoporosis. Number two  it can g it prevents your body from fighting infection. Number three it can put up your blood pressure. Number four it can give you liver changes it can do all sorts of things . But it can save your life. What I suggest you do is this. I suggest you go back and see the specialist and you say to him Doctor have you got a diagnosis for me  do you think it is wise for me to stay on Prednisone for the next I don't know how long  um because if you haven't got a diagnosis for me then what the hell am I taking the Prednisone for. And take it from there. But  it can cure you it can save your life but it can also kill you so be careful okay.

 Okay great thanks a lot there.

 Bye Chris.

 Bye-bye.



 Margaret good morning.

 Oh good morning Dr Graham and Luke. Doctor uh two years ago I had severe pancreatitis.

 Right.

 Uh and.

 That's a really really that and renal colic are the two worst pains that you can have.

 Yes. Well I uh ended up I had the an abscess on the pancreas  and I lost half my pancreas  and then they had to um do a bypass . In now at that stage I was sick quite a lot and couldn't keep anything down for months  and had bile  so last night I was sick again and it didn't come on till about half past twelve which was about six or seven hours  after I'd eaten  and it was only bile that I was bringing up.

 Okay. How long ago did you have the pancreatitis and the operation.

 The la well the operation was six years ago  but I the last attack I had was two years ago.

 Right and you've been absolutely pain free since then.

 For that yes.

 Okay.

 I actually stopped the vomiting about five o'clock this morning because I suffer with Meniere's . And I had some um Stemetil suppositories that  I took to stop the vomiting this  morning.

 Margaret I think you've gotta approach this from a common sense point of view. Your concern is that it might be the pancreatitis coming back.

 Yes.

 And c the common things occur commonly. Now just because you've had pancreatitis and an operation on your pancreas and a bypass  doesn't mean that you can get a l number of other things that cause you to feel sick. The best guide is do you feel or did you feel last night like you felt two or three years ago when you had this problem before. And I guess if you really thought about it the answer is no  because from the sounds of things this morning it's settling down. What I would suggest that you do is in the f common sense basic principles. Don't go and gorge yourself over the weekend. Take small meals and often and try and stick to the clear fluids over the weekend a little and often . If the vomiting is still there on Monday morning it certainly is worth a trip back to your G P. But my my guess is that over the weekend if you just have uh Bonox or chicken broth or.

 I can't have Bonox because it's two high in salt for the Meniere's.

 Right that's fair enough um then what else can I think of just some chicken broth or my mum used to make a great chicken soup with a little bit of rice in it and just  the broth off that with a little bit of rice  nothing fatty nothing greasy and little and often so if you had  a cup of a cup of chicken broth and drank it over a half an hour and then a couple of hours later another one and then a couple of hours later another one  rather than sit down to meat and three veg and some gravy  and if you're still uh vomiting on Monday I'd be going straight back to your G P but my gut feeling is that common things occur commonly and it's probably just a passing viral .



 Fourteen past eleven.

 Anne good morning.

 Good morning Dr Graham and Luke. Uh Dr Graham  my mother's just been put on the last three months uh I hope I pronounce it correctly for you the injection D E C A.

 Deca Durabolin.

 Yes  and Caltrate  the tablets . Mum's had uh breaks in both of her arms  and broken ribs . Now what I'd like to ask you is yesterday mum had her third injection . Now our G P you can't sort of discuss things with him I don't know why but that's how things have been the last few months . I tried to ask him yesterday how long mum will be on the injections . And as I said I couldn't get anything out of him would you be kind enough 'cos mum has naturally osteoporosis . I was wondering if you would be k so kind 'n' explain to me does mum stay on the injection plus the Caltrate for life or is it only a set period of time. 

 Anne can I ask you who put her on it.

 The uh the G P. 

 The G P.

 Yes.

 Okay. Deca Durabolin is a hormone injection. It is designed it's called Nandrolone and it's really quite an unusual hormone it is designed to put calcium back into the bones. But does suffer from a lot of the complications that uh other hormones do in that it does put your blood pressure up and a few things like that . It is however very effective ih in putting calcium back into the bones. My feeling is that she's probably going to be on that for the rest of her life. How often is she having the injections. 

 Uh the once every month. The  eighth of each month.

 The eighth of each month. I would think that she's probably going to be on it more or less for the rest of her life however what I would suggest she do is ask her G P if she could get a referral to an endocrinologist who specialises in osteoporosis . There are so many ways of treating people with osteoporosis that I believe it's always wise for somebody to hold have a guiding influence over that and as a G P yes I I can initiate treatment for osteoporosis but I'm often more comfortable if somebody who sees a lot of osteoporosis uh has a hand in the treatment even if it's just to say yes Dr Graham you're going okay I don't want to change anything.
 
 May I ask uh one question should you have regular blood tests with anything like this Dr Graham. 

 I look I'm a great believer in doing r le regular blood tests on on everybody 'n' by regular it means different things to different people  but for example I like to get everybody in my patients' cholesterol checked every six to twelve months depending on whether it's been up  evr especially if they've got high blood pressure at least once a year I like to get their kidneys checked out and if they're diabetics I like to get their what's called haemoglobin A one C checked at least twice a year. So yes it's worthwhile getting regular blood tests done  it's even more worthwhile if you're on something like Deca Durabolin.



 Yes you're listening to the doc  Doc Graham. Until midday today then the Continuous Call Team Andrew Moore heading up th the uh the team this uh this weekend. We'll take a break this is Two G B.



 Michael good morning.

 Oh hi there good morning Doctor. Uh Doctor I got uh just a question if I may uh I sneeze like heck when I when I change temperatures like if I get from the cold and go into a car with the heater on  I sneeze uh uh um a real lot and that's the same as though if I get outta the shower and I don't dry myself real a warm shower and don't dry myself real quickly I sneeze again like that or if I I go out of a warm house outside without a lotta coats on I sneeze like heck again .

 Has this been happening has this been happening all the time Michael or it is just something new.

 Oh no it's been happening for a while. Few years I s'pose.

 Okay uh  excuse me your nose is the reason you sneeze is you get an irritation in the mucous membrane of your nose . Now you can sneeze wuh in the Spring and the Autumn because of hay fever which is pollen actually irritating your nose . But fairly obviously you've got a sensitive nose  and the change in temperature is irritating your nose . Now I don't think that there's anything that you can do about it but equally  I don't think it's ih all that serious either.

 Nah.

 If it did become serious  you could reduce the sensitivity of the mucous membrane of your nose  by taking one of the over the counter antihistamines that are readily available such as Claritin or Telfast and  they do tend to reduce the sensitivity of the mucous membrane. The  other thing that your doctor could do if it really became a problem  would be to give you a nose spray a cortisone-based nose spray. That  that also reduces the sensitivity. Be  careful. Do not be temperted  to take stuff like Sinex which has got pseudoephedrine in it and you can become addicted to it . Not serious. Don't worry about it and the only reason you'd do something about it if it really causes you some trouble and there are a number of treatment options available.

 Yeah no it doesn't cause any major problems you know it doesn't it doesn't turn into the flu or anything . I've had the flu needle and that so.

 No that's fine don't worry about it okay. Thanks Michael.



 Cathy good morning.

 Hi good morning Dr Graham. I've just found out that I'm pregnant . And um.

 Congrat con congratulations.

 Oh thank you so much. 

 First one second one.

 Number two.

 Number two and what've you got at home.

 I've got a boy three .

 A boy three.

 Yes.

 You know I have been known over the years to to be part owners in in race horses  and I have a um a a boy a girl and a boy  and I hope this one's a girl for you  because I reckon that's a king's wish  and if I ever get to name a race horse again it'll be king's wish.

 King's wish. Why don't we send her some flowers.

 Gee that'd be great.

 We'll s we'll send you can we send you some flowers before you even start.

 .

 Fresh flowers dot com dot A U. Okay when you're finished with dr Graham we'll put you back in the waiting room and uh Daisy'll look after you okay.

 Oh thank you.

 Now tell me what can I do to help.

 What I've had um last year I had this really unbelievable virus  um that left me sort of wuh I've been told sort of like with chronic fatigue.

 Yes.

 But I've been fighting it off naturally.

 Right well  yes you're gunna get fatigued now  with this pregnancy.

 I know what so what can I do I don't I didn't wanna leave it too long so I've just persevered and my blood count's fine but my E S R's always high.  And I've seen a professor and everything.

 This is prior to falling pregnant.

 No this is just last week so would that attribute. She thinks it's a non-specific test and so  she doesn't know  if it's because of the pregnancy also but it's like forty-nine.

 That is a little bit high yes.

 Do you think.

 It's a little bit high okay. Which part of the world do you live in Cathy.

 Um si I live in Maroubra.

 Right. 

 Yeah and  also I've got really bad neck and jaw pain from the virus. 

 Okay let's take this in two parts.

 Yeah.

 The mai how far pregnant are you how many weeks.

 I I'm only six weeks.

 Right so you're only just pregnant. 

 Yeah.

 The first thing you need to d and did have you had any miscarriages.

 No.

 So you had one live child this is the second time you've been pregnant.

 Yes. 

 Okay. The first thing you need to do is ensure a successful outcome for this pregnancy.

 Yes.

 So irrespective of what else is going on in your life you've got sore arms you've got sore legs you've got a sore back you've got sore something or other  the first priority is this pregnancy . Therefore you need to go and see a competent obstetrician  and say look I've got an elevated E S R  uh uh nobody's quite sure of the significance of it but  I am pregnant and I want a successful outcome to this pregnancy . So everything else takes second place at this point in time  to the pregnancy . And irrespective of what the reason for the elevated E S R is as long as that baby's growing well  and growing healthily and is normal  then everything else can be put on hold until after the pregnancy . So don't try and look for multiple answers  just concentrate on one thing  and that is the successful outcome of this pregnancy.

 Um once you spoke about a j a person with jaw pain and and I think you send them off to  a specialist or.

 They had T M J arthritis but Cathy.

 Yeah.

 Theh just just hang on half a tick. Let me just say it again . Because this is really important to get this message through . The the area that you should be concentrating on  is the bit between the knees and the navel . That's the baby . We're not gunna concentrate on our jaw if it's sore then we have might have to take some panadol or some disprin for it  but everything else goes on hold and I mean everything  until this baby is delivered successfully . Now yes you might have a sore jaw yes you might have a sore toe yes you might have a headache but it's all secondary  to the progress of this pregnancy . If you can sit back and say this pregnancy's going along alright and I can't find a reason for having a sore toe or a sore knee or a sore neck I'll just take something symptomatically that's not gunna hurt the baby and we'll worry about it after this baby's born.

 Okay theh good advice there I think Cathy.

 Okay thank you.

 Stay right there s 'cos I wanna send you some flowers  w when are you  when are you due.

 Um January five.

 Oh it's a while  to go  it's only six weeks. 

 So that means thirty uh  thirty-four weeks to go.

 Do do you want the flowers now or when you when you have the baby.

 No give them to her now  don't be mean.

 I'll  stay there Daisy will get your details Cathy 'n' there's the advice from the doc I could I could sense that you don't have a dog and bark as well coming on there but.

[E1 No no no  we haven't done that today.

 Haven't had one yet today but I can feel one coming on.

 No well only if it's appropriate.

 Only if it's appropriate. 

 Yes.

 Alright then.



 Your chance to go into the draw for a trip to China coming up very soon also Matters Male and Medical we'll be talking with Dr Dennis Cherry the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre. Is that correct.

 That's indeed correct.

 Okay and uh if you have any male problems that you would like to discuss we'll give you plenty of opportunity between quarter to and midday.

 We're gunna keep Dr Cherry on the line and he may well be able to an help us el answer these questions. Uh Brian good morning.

 Oh good morning Doctor. Um  run wide and stepped in the side. What can you.

 Wide and step inside.

 What can you tell me about Laetrile there's a mate of mine uh who's uh riddled with cancer over there in Western Australia . And he won't have his chemo he says no that's not on he's had a lash at that but he's uh uh having um these infusions  of Laetrile what do you n what can you tell me about it.

 Not a lot Brian. Laetrile's been around for a long time and it certainly doesn't form part of the mainstream treatment for cancer . It's supposed to have come from almonds or something like that.

 Uh the uh the kernels of the apricot.

 Apricots I'm sorry it was apricots  I apologise. Um and interestingly enough uh it's it's been around for about forty years  but um the composition of the Laetrile now is not the same as the composition of the Laetrile some years ago . Um it certainly doesn't form part of the mainstream treatment but I'll tell you one thing about somebody who's got an incurable disease. You never take away hope . Under any circumstances  you don't take away hope . And that's the most important thing which you can do. If he thinks that it's working it's it's working. He's opted not for mains t not to take mainstream treatment  support him. That's the only thing that you can do.

 Good on you mate.

 See you Brian.

 Thanks.



 Earlier this morning we were talking about the House of Hearts which was up for auction today um proceeds going to uh Westmead Children's Hospital.

 Yes indeed 'n' what was the result do we know.

 Well Gilly Paxton is one of the organisers she's there now Gilly good morning.

 Good morning again how are you.

 Well we're very very well well. The auction was at just after eleven o'clock was did it start on time.

 Yes we did we started pretty much on time but unfortunately the house didn't sell this morning it didn't meet its reserve and so it's going to go up for sale um on Monday and so anybody who's missed out hasn't been able to have a look at it um you still have a great chance to buy this wonderful house. But for the hospital um it was very exciting because Landcom and the minister actually gave us a cheque for half a million dollars pending  the sale of the house   such good news yes.

 Isn't that good.

 So it was a wonderful morning for us um a and obviously for the lucky person who's eventually going to live in this splendid house um so  maybe good for them it didn't sell too.

 It didn't sell what's ih what is the reserve.

 Oh I don't I don't think I I duh I'm not sure if I'm allowed to tell you that so so I probably shouldn't.

 Oh okay . Uh it didn't meet the reserve so  Mark Moraza was thinking it would get six-hundred to six-fifty. It didn't make the reserve yeah well ob you you can't tell us what the reserve is so um we can only guess it's gunna go for sale for the sale now .

 The the the vendor's bid was five-eighty so that probably gives um people an idea of where they were looking um .

 Five-eight wm ma I think Mark was probably on the money six-hundred  to six-fifty.

 I'd say  he was on the money.

 Probably was yeah.

 Alright listen thank you for that I'm sorry it didn't sell um because that means the Westmead Children's Hospital misses out but they they will eventually get something.

 Absolutely and as I say we did we did actually get a cheque for half a million dollars today from Landcom  um you know sort of ahead of the sale so we're very fortunate and the kids are very fortunate um and it's just been the best project.

 Alright Gilly thanks for that keep us informed will you.

 Thank you will do  bye-bye.

 Gilly Paxton oh there you go didn't sell but.

 Oh it's a funny market at the minute.

 It is indeed.  It is indeed. It we'll take a break it's nineteen to twelve Two G B.

 Luke thanks again once again to our sponsors Lilly Pharmaceuticals we're in a position to bring to the attention of our listeners  the importance of one common symptom. It's possibly the clue that they need to recognise that they might be at risk of an underlying disease process. The symptom that all these disease processes have in common is erectile dysfunction. No-one talks about this problem  yet it's estimated that about thirty-nine percent of males  between the age of forty and sixty-nine have got erectile dysfunction and of those twelve percent have complete erectile dysfunction. Yet this is a problem that always happens to somebody else. Well it's my intention as best I can  to encourage any of my listeners who've got this problem to discuss it with their G Ps. On the line to tell us about what else might be wrong if you've got elecrectile  dysfunction  is Dr Dennis Cherry the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre Dennis good morning.

 Good morning Graham.

 How are you.

 I'm very well and yourself.

 Very well thank you. Uh Dennis could you tell us a little bit about the Human Sexuality Centre.

 Well it's a s uh centre that we have here in Perth uh which looks at both male and female sexual dysfunction across a broad spectrum of uh sexual disorders running from  what you've just spoken abou that is erectile dysfunction  along with uh disorders of ejaculation premature ejaculation that is coming too quickly or even retarded or delayed or absent ejaculation  uh through to loss of libido through to uh transgender p dysphoria uh even aspects of uh gay sexuality  and uh that is across the full spectrum of even philias uh paraphilic behaviours and fetishes and those sorts of things.

 All sorts of things.

 Yes.

 Uh Dennis if there're any of our listeners out there whose neighbour's got erectile dysfunction they haven't got it themselves. Uh their neighbour's got it. What else might they be at risk of.

 Well w what you have to remember of course is that the penis is nothing more than a glorified blood vessel . And as a consequence of that any of the disorders that affect blood vessels will affect the penis . And hence if you look at the issues that are associated for example  uh diabetes heart disease peripheral vascular disease hypertension disorders of
cholesterol excess cigarette smoking and of course a lack of exercise and uh central truncal obesity. And now we're getting down to the lifestyle issues  which affect the blood vessels  and tha and that becomes extremely important.

 Okay heart disease  are you sy are you saying that somebody who has erectile dysfunction might have heart disease.

 And also the corollary that is vice versa. Anybody that's got heart disease will have a h strong probability that they're going to have erectile dysfunction  and in fact there are now increasing evidence in the literature that those men that have erectile dysfunction  it's a lead in to the fact that there's a strong probability that they may have uh sub-clinical or non s asymptomatic heart disease. So either or  should make you wake up and sit up and take notice and think mm perhaps I ought to be  much more aware of what's going in inside my body. If you think that the coronary arteries are about the same size as the cavernosal arteries which are the tiny arteries that lead into the penis . And if you accept the fact that there's a probability that what happens throughout the body is fairly equal then you can see that there is good reason to believe that if it's happening to the cavernosal or the coronary arteries then the opposite is almost certainly to be true.

 Tell us about syndrome X.

 Well syndrome X is also called the metabolic syndrome and it's and I'm glad you brought that up 'cos it brings into the issue those lifestyle factors that are affecting uh our community in large numbers.

 Right.

 It's perhaps has it's beginning in fact way back in the womb and there's some interesting work being done f for a condition for a condition called FOAD F O A D which is foetal onset of adult disease.

 What what what is syndrome X though ih ih.

 Syndrome X is is um ih is where you um have ih obesity truncal obesity you have insulin resistance you have glucose intolerance and you have hypertension and those issues uh stem from a metabolic abnormality  which then leads you into getting vascular disease.

 It's almost like Homer Simpson this heart the Homer Simpson look I guess.

 That's uh in fact almost down to a nutshell because what Homer's got is the male pattern baldness and he's got that central obesity  and the interesting thing about syndrome X is that with this central truncal obesity you get a lot of conversion of the male hormone testosterone across to oestradiol and so you get alteration in the male's pattern of hormone flux and as a consequence of that it also leads into this other condition that we won't talk about now but mention and that is the male what's so-called the male andropause so there's a linkage right across the spectrum of disorders that are affecting men of our age.

 And  people with s people who uh have erectile dysfunction may well have syndrome X as well.

 It's oh almost well almost certainly there can be other causes for erectile dysfunction neurogenic  but more than uh more than most likely that will be the case Graham.

 Okay now n nobody wants to talk about this so but we're going to talk about it. If you've got erectile dysfunction how can it be treated.

 Well very successfully today I mean m most men are are and their partners in fact perhaps even more so the latter are aware of the fact that uh we have now got some very good treatments in the oral what we call the oral P D E fives. That as a group they consist of Viagra Cialis and Levitra. These are wonderful compounds that in fact affect the whole vascular system. Uh they work on improving the biochemical processes that lead to relaxation of blood vessels and lead to the relaxation of the erectile tissue and thereby help and promote erections.

 So it's it's not all over you're not six foot under and dead if you if you've uh if you've got erectile dysfunction and as a result you you find that you've got heart disease there's lots of things that we can do.

 Oh my word in fact uh y'know you can revitalise your life as long as you use this as a uh uh as a an essential warning which says oops looks like things aren't going too well I've gotta get myself back in  uh take stock of things and get myself back into uh order.

 Dennis we're gunna have to go for a break would you mind holding on for a moment and we're gunna ask any of our listeners out there  if they've got a problem they might be concerned and they might .

 Or if they have a neighbour.

 Or if they've g sorry they they haven't got it themselves then that's right  it's their neighbour that's got the problem .

 Or a friend.

 Okay. Let's.

 I'm delighted to be here.

 Let's um let's ask one of our listeners who's never ever ever discussed this before in the an anonymity of the radio  to ring in and talk to us  because it just might save their life.

 And certainly m save a relationship it's eleven minutes to twelve  one-three-one-eight-seven-three if you'd like to talk to Dr Dennis Cherry and Dr Graham about this  very very sensitive issue and if you've been uh uh uh uh a little bit hesitant to talk about it  now is the time. It can be completely anonymous you can ring up for your neighbour if you like one-three-one-   eight-seven-three it's eleven to twelve.



 It's eight minutes to twelve the Continuous Call Team headed by Andrew Moore this afternoon  after twelve o'clock today one-three-one-eight-seven-three is the telephone number Dr Dennis Cherry is joining us the medical director of the Perth Human Sexuality Centre and uh Dr Graham and uh we'll take a call and I think we have Errol on line Errol gm good morning.

 Hi.

 G'day Errol.

 I'm in me mid seventies.

 Right

 Uh I had a T U R on my prostate  about eleven years ago.

 Right.

 And I found out then that it didn't work afterwards.

 Right . What didn't w what didn't work the T U R or.

  get an erection . Couldn't substain  it you know . The urge is still there today even probably ten times as strong . Uh I have three stents in my heart and one in my aorta . Uh I have vascular problems in my leg.

 Right. Have you got  an have you got angina still.

 Yes I'm still being treated for angina yeah.

 Right. Dennis what can we say to Errol.

 Can I take any of these pills.

 Uh w well if he's got angina and if he's using nitrates that's the little things you slip under the tongue or the spray that you use then it would be prohibited to use the new pills that's uh Viagra Cialis and Levitra  because they interact badly to cause a quite a significant drop in blood pressure or they can do and   you won't know when that would be  so that would be out of the question.

 I've tried the needles and things  I've had the dopular  x-rays and things scans . And they say the blood comes in and goes out the other end just as quick.

 Yes.

 Right.

   tablets stop that.

 No d uh the problem you have is now what they venous incompetence that is  the erectile tissue is so damaged it can't lock off and  lock out.

 Almost like a varicose vein down there isn't it.

 That's right yeah and it's a bit like a hydraulic pump that the valve mechanism is now just so badly damaged it can't respond.

 So I g I've got no hope.

 Well the uh the the only one hope you've got is either the possibility of vacuum erection devices and or a penile implant and at your age I think uh and vascular disease   be few surgeons that would want to look at you.

 It would  it would be very very difficult one. Errol I think unfortunately  this is one of the situations where the options are very very very limited the only thing that I can suggest to you however is go to your cardiologist  and say to him Doctor I I've got this problem there is tablets that are available but am I able to take them and ask him exactly will you fall into the category that you can or can't take these tablets.

 Errol thanks for your call Pamela good morning.

 Pamela yes good morning Pamela.

 Yes good morning Doctor.

 Good morning.

 How are you.

 I'm well thanks how are you. You got two doctors to talk to you today.

 Aren't I lucky.

 Yeah.

  Well I'm ringing on behalf of my husband 'n' he's not here at the moment.

 Right.

 Uh he's sixty years of age  and uh  uh he's uh .

 Pamela  just just hang on one sec. Look number one it's very brave of you to ring because it's obviously a difficult thing for you to do.

 It is.

 Number two  this precisely why we k having this segment because nobody damn well wants to talk about it. And it's a problem not only for the men  it can be a problem for the women too.

 Oh yes of course I do realise that.

 So let's get it just pretend that there's nobody else and there isn't anybody else there's you and myself and Dr Cherry so just spit it out.

 Alright yes um  he's been there's been difficulty in getting an erection for the we've been married twenty years for for eighteen years now . Uh he is on Warfarin . He's got very bad vascular veins he has has had a couple of ulcers on the veins as well but  that's been cleared.

 Right they're probably venous ulcers right.

 Yes he's had uh uh the lump uh but the then the theh then he was put on Warfarin about eight nine years ago  . But before before that he's always had a problem with an erection his  his testicles are very small  and uh I just um. He  finds it difficult to talk about but because .

 Absolutely most men do find it very difficult to talk about it.

 And and I am just you know just yearning.

 At your wits yeah at your wits end Dennis what advice would you give Pamela.

 Well certainly he needs a very thorough investigation there if if the comment she made about the small testicles is true we know that men who have poor testosterone production have a very ih testosterone's extremely important in maintaining the health of the erectile tissue . So without that he would certainly be going downhill. Second thing  is that if he's got venous disease  uh and it's venous vascular disease then there may well be some arterial component as well . So he needs a very he needs to see I mean the point you made Graham is very true he needs to see a doctor he needs to be worked up thoroughly  uh and as a consequence of that a real proper assessment made as to why he hasn't got erectile dysfunction I I wouldn't be surprised by now that there's a rather intense psychogenic component.

 M tt so uh it's like a dog chasing it's tail it doesn't work and the more you worry about it the less it works.

 That's right.

 Pamela this is really important what Dr Cherry has said is that your husband  even if you can get him to go to the doctor just purely and simply for a check-up.

 Well he does see him for his I N R but we.

 No that's neither here nor there and you've gotta go with him and you say  why don't you tell the doctor what's going on. I heard this program on Two G B that said you might be at risk of diabetes you might be at risk of heart disease. Tell him what's going on  and maybe he can help you and really  maybe he can help both of you. Pamela look thank you very much for calling in  Dennis I'm sorry we've run out of time. I really appreciated you taking the time this morning  and it's amazing the board lit up like a christmas tree I'm telling you there's a big problem out there and that's precisely why we're doing this segment. Thanks again Dennis really  appreciate it.

 Bye-bye.

 Bye.

 Dr Dennis Cherry. It's two minutes to twelve we ha yes you're right we do have to take a break we'll be back.

Ends 1:04.27.2"
